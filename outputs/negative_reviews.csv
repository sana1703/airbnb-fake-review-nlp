The rung on the stool will pop out when you try to put your feet on it. The table leg is held together by Saran Wrap. The couch is darned. The towels so threadbare that they leave fuzz all over your face when you try to dry it. There’s stuff everywhere - bird statues, hanging plaques, prayers hung on the wall, just dusty old crap that you have to constantly move and keep clean. <br/><br/>The owner herself admitted to me in a text that they hadn’t bought anything new for the place in years. The host was another problem. She texted constantly. On my second day she started texting asking me to commit to staying longer. I told her I didn’t know my plans (true) and it was too soon for me to make a decision. She kept texting and then, on my last day, tried to guilt trip me for not staying - claiming they’d turned down other renters because they’d thought I’d stay (even though I have texts explicitly telling her to do ahead and rent to someone else because I didn’t know what I was doing !). She also tried to get me to sign another lease and told me if I did stay we could go outside the air bnb platform. She made me very uncomfortable. <br/><br/>The grass in the backyard is gross, prickly and crabgrass. So you won’t enjoy the backyard space. The area isn’t walkable, so not great if you bring a dog.<br/><br/>Speaking of dogs...they allowed them but told me they’d never had them before. The host was clearly uncomfortable having one in the condo. On the last day she insisted on coming for a walk through. I warned her that my dog was still a puppy and might react to a stranger in her place. She said fine. <br/><br/>After I left and after she said everything was fine on the walk through, she texted that she’d found a small puddle of dog pee. I said that my dog probably peed a little on the floor when the owner came in because she was scared and apologized for not catching it. She tried to charge me $100 for clean up. <br/><br/>She also tried to claim that a pee stain on the mattress pad was from my stay and charge me $100 for that. But I’d stripped the bed and washed all the sheets for her before moving out, she saw the mattress pad on her walk through and had no issue with it! In short, because she was upset with me for not staying I feel like she tried whatever excuse she could to get more money out of me. <br/><br/>It sucks because this was my first time using Air BnB and id been really nervous after hearing bad stories about it, and this experience wasn’t great. I’d even paid out of my own pocket $150 to have it professionally cleaned before I left (they never cleaned it while I was there) because I was worried about having issues with the host. <br/><br/>Poor location (which the host discloses in the listing), annoying host who will text you constantly.

There's a school at the end of the block so most of the street parking is taken during the day. There was a big event going on over the weekend down SoCo so there was also little to no parking for most of the weekend.

CONS: Unsatisfactory resolution to cockroaches found in the kitchen. <br/>For the amount of money spent to rent this home, I expect to not have to deal with pest control on a daily basis. I certainly do not expect to have to deal with a sanitation/potential health issue for the entire length of my trip. It seemed as though roaches were an acceptable inconvenience with the host, based on the host’s communication lag and inability to satisfactorily rectify the problem.  However, as a service provider, our problem should have been his problem to solve expeditiously and without excuse. If pest control is a problem whereby service is needed monthly between quarterly visits, why not leave a can of roach spray under the sink for emergencies? At the very least, as a lodging host, hire a service that has better response times.<br/>Saturday  morning: We contacted the host about finding 4 roaches over 1 ½ days in the dishwasher and sink. No response.<br/>Sunday  morning: We heard back from the host who said the house is exterminated quarterly and was last serviced in July, although the check-in instructions stated the quarterly service was scheduled for Tuesday at 11AM. <br/>Monday late morning: We finally heard back from the host who said the earliest the exterminator can come out is now 6PM Tuesday.

We were told that basic breakfast items and snacks would be provided, but there was nothing left out for us or marked as food for guests. Just a couple of half empty bags of chips on the island.

Here are the pros and cons we observed so you can decide whether or not it's worth it to you to book this bnb:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Central location to downtown Austin making it easy to walk around a lot.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. Unresponsive host: when I notified the host that all 5 of us were unable to connect to the wifi, he simply said it must be a problem with our electronics because he stood outside the condo and was able to connect to the wifi without an issue. He then ignored my follow up messages that we still couldn't connect to the wifi.<br/><br/>2. Poor wifi connection: While the host just blamed us for not being able to connect to wifi and refused to look into it any more, we figured out that actually the wifi connection is poor because the router is in a centralized location not in the unit so you might have connection for a few seconds just then you'd get kicked off right away.<br/><br/>3. Poor lighting: the lights are quite dim and there's no way to turn it up. Ladies, you will have a hard time putting on make up in the terrible lighting.<br/><br/>4. Iron has a caked-on black substance on it that got on my clothing when I used it.

I wanted to write a full blown, detailed review but this whole ordeal with Ryan was so exhausting I am only going to commit to the CliffsNotes version.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>1) There were other guests sleeping in the unit when we arrived. We entered the unit and their stuff was everywhere, and eventually they SCREAMED at us to leave. Turns out his cleaning team let them in. Serious safety issue #1<br/>2) We booked this 3 bedroom so we could stay together but were forced to split up in temporary units for the first night. Both bathrooms in one of the temporary units were also not in the best condition. The toilets and showers were filthy and we were not okay with using the showers (I have photos of the conditions).<br/>3) Our first morning in the temporary unit, people attempted to  enter the unit for ONE HOUR. They tried opening the front door and were banging on the windows. Fortunately we had deadbolted the front door the night before so they weren't able to enter.<br/>Ryan later confirmed that it was his maintenance staff trying enter the unit. He had scheduled work with them prior and failed to successfully cancel once he allowed us to use the unit temporarily for the day. If we hadn't deadbolted the front door, they would have entered the unit while we were sleeping... Serious safety issue #2<br/>4) Ryan admitted fault initially (confirmed (1) that his cleaning crew let the other people into our originally booked unit, and (2) that he never got a cancellation confirmation from his maintenance crew in the temporary unit) but denied responsibility when I asked him if there was any way we could work out a refund/comp for the first night. He denied any wrong doing and responsibility and complained about how he now had to pay for 3 different cleaning services he didn't originally plan (for the random strangers who squatted in our originally booked apartment, and for the two temporary places he offered to us). He had a condescending and terrible attitude.<br/><br/>Fortunately we were able to get a refund for our first night once Airbnb launched an investigation into the case. They reviewed all of the messages we had with Ryan through the app and confirmed that he violated multiple host guidelines. <br/><br/>There is not a case where I would ever consider booking a stay with Ryan again. I know that Ryan has a lot of positive reviews (something I look for when I am booking an Airbnb), but I do hope that you think twice when considering reserving through him. It is easy to click 5 stars when you're able to easily access the Airbnb you booked and it generally aligns with the expectations set through the booking description, but the way a host mediates a situation when things don't go according to plan is all the more important.

We checked in on Thursday, stayed the night, and were enjoying our stay in Austin. We had been using the bathroom throughout our stay, and nothing was wrong. We had left the house early Friday morning, and returned around 4:00. One guest used the bathroom, and realized that there was water all over the bathroom floor. We were not sure where it was coming from, but assumed it was from the toilet. We flushed the toilet to test our assumption, and we were right. This time, a large amount of water rushed out from the seal between the toilet and the floor. We rushed to dry it up with the towels form the house. In the meantime, we tested the shower to make sure it was just the toilet. As soon as we turned the water on in the shower, water rushed out from the seal between the bathtub and the floor. At this point, the whole bathroom was flooded. It was so flooded that water seeped into the bedroom next to the bathroom and ruined a suitcase that was in a closet. During this time, we were calling and leaving voicemails for Laura. There was no response. I even reached out via Airbnb, and left text a text message. After sending the text message, we finally received a call back. I explained what was happening with the bathroom. Laura's response was to use the bathroom of the condo attached to ours. We assumed the attached condo was furnished, and we would just move next door. After finding the key to enter the attached condo, we enter to see there is no furniture, no shower curtain, nothing. Laura had suggested that we should use this bathroom for the remainder of our trip. We felt that was an incredibly insensitive response coming from a Host. To suggest that a group of girls have to go outside to another condo to use a bathroom throughout the rest of our 3 days in Austin was silly. We did not feel comfortable doing this at all. We were not comfortable with going next door in the middle of the night to use a bathroom. It was at this point where we asked if she could send a plumber.

Eventually, Laura sent a plumber and asked us to stay for the plumber to arrive. By this point it is 5:00 in the evening.

When we arrived at the home, some men were already in the home we were supposed to be staying in. There were lots of boxes and junk in front of that home. Also, the men were shirtless and had large dogs in the yard (very strong dog smell.) We assumed they lived there. Thinking we had received the wrong apartment number, we tried the other apartment which is in the same property (side by side.) The keypad door unlocked with the code Laura had sent us. When we went into the home, we noticed it was not the home we had rented. We had rented a 3 bedroom 1 bath and this was a 2 bedroom 1 bath. Immediately, I try to contact Laura and she was not readily available. I had to contact Airbnb, send the pictures of the home we were in & explain that was not our rental. We were finally able to reach Laura and that’s when she cleared up that the men next door had gone into the wrong rental. That meant both homes had the same unlock code. I spoke to the men next door and they apologized for going into the wrong home. They stated they could clean up “quickly” and switch homes. I asked how long they had been at the rental and they stated 2 days and 1 night. I went back in the other apartment and another unknown male came knocking harshly asking “to see the apartment they were getting.” He stormed into the home and started to look at the yard “for their dogs.” I told him this was the home they had originally booked and he walked out upset. We spoke to Laura again and asked her if she could have someone come clean the home, as the men had slept in the beds and also had the dogs indoor.

The beds were clean and comfortable and plenty of towels supplied.  However the property needs an major overhaul. The furniture was old and tired and looked like it was donated by goodwill with only one sad grubby cushion on sofa.  The garden was in total disarray and unkept, the garden furniture was dirty, basic and uncomfortable. The BBQ was unuseable and filthy.  There were unsightly wires coming out of the back of the TV, (a hazard if you have young children).  The kitchen pans should be replaced. They were old and grubby and no kettle provided. The plates were a mishmash with no thought for family usage.  The internet was patchy and we had connection issues throughout our two week stay.   Overall, very disappointing. They should either reduce their rates to reflect the actual condition of the property or upgrade as the photographs are misleading.  Would not recommend staying here.

The apartment is in a great location, and we knew it would be a smaller place, but the overall quality was not what we expected. First off, all of the previous reviews are 5 stars. Leading us to believe that it would be a 5 star experience, and now we're just suspicious of the ratings provided of the apartment by ""previous guests""<br/><br/>When we walked in, the place was damp and hot, she requests that the AC be turned off when you leave, and it was a 97 degree day, so that does not add for a comfortable situation. The room immediately smelled very moldy and musty, not very pleasant. We go to turn on a few lights, but the main light in the living area was flickering and did not work. She did leave a note saying she was trying to get an electrician out and would let us know when someone could come, someone did not come while we were visiting. It happens, we appreciated the effort.<br/><br/>We walked around the unit and noticed that the apartment was not very clean. It was actually quite gross. There was black mold on the bathroom tiles and shower curtain, the shower was dirty, there was a ring in the toilet, a TON of LONG BLACK hairs all over the shower and bathroom floor (I have short dark hair and my GF has long blonde hair, definitely from a previous guest) a large mattress was in the closet preventing us from being able to open the door all the way, and the sheets on the bed were DISGUSTING. They reeked of mildew or like someone left them in the washing machine for days and just put them straight in the dryer after, so we changed them, but the back up sheets smelled even worse! We finally found another bottom sheet that didn't smell, but when we got it on the bed, there was a giant stain on them! I understand that we are staying in someone's home, but if you have people paying a nightly rate, invest in some decent sheet sets. None of the sheets matched, they were scratchy, and the bed was so uncomfortable, we hardly slept the entire visit.<br/><br/>On top of this, we decided to get some groceries on our first night for the weekend and the next afternoon we realized the refrigerator and freezer did not work at all, so about $100 worth of groceries had completely spoiled. We notified Kristen of what happened and she did bring up a mini fridge while we were out, but for the fridge/ freezer and a light to be out and not offer any kind of discount is pretty distasteful. <br/><br/>We still had a great trip, but the accommodations are no where near 5 stars like we were expecting, and we did not feel like it was worth it for the price.

The shower was very dirty as it looked as if it had not been clean for weeks with mold residue throughout the corners and base of the tub. The faucet of the tub leaks so there is rust in multiple places of the tub, not to mention, the entire night you hear non-stop leaking from the faucet in the tub. I'm so glad I brought shower shoes because it is not a shower you want to step in bare foot as it was not clean at all. I arrived at midnight and went straight for the bed, only to find when I pulled back the comforter, hair! There was hair on the sheets and pillow and a stain on the pillow case. The sheets were not clean at all. Needless to say, I did not get into the covers, for 3 nights I slept on top of the comforter in a fetal position with no pillow or covers. When I went to the spare room to grab a blanket, the room the blankets were in, the ceiling looked as if it had been leaking and there was mold. So I opted to just sleep with no blankets on top of the comforter. Not ideal as I was traveling for business and needed adequate sleep. The next day I bought Lysol to at least disinfect the place. But the place was definitely not cleaned before me and its not as it appears in the pictures online. The walls are dirty, microwave was dirty on the panel, the counter tops in both the bathroom and kitchen were dirty, it just was not clean. When I cleaned the counter tops using paper towels, it was so much dirt and residue that came from cleaning I was disgusted!  This was my first and last time I'll do airbnb.

So much so, that I was really looking forward to this extended stay at Charlotte's place while I looked for a permanent home in Austin after relocating from NYC. Unfortunately, this ended up being a stay that I was happy to have come to an end. Below are the highlights of the good and the bad. Please take from them what you will. Let's start with some good things: 1) The location is close to downtown and in a nice neighborhood. 2) The property is quiet and backs up to greenspace. 3) The unit is well equipped and has access to laundry. 4) Charlotte added a landline phone to the unit for me as cell service can be spotty and I work from home. 5) Easy access to the Hike and Bike trail and neighborhood pool. 6) The price for the unit was very reasonable compared to the surrounding market. Here are some of the bad things: 1) Although the location is close to downtown it isn't really walkable to anything. You'll need to have a car or access to Uber to get around. 2) Cockroaches. This place has tons of them. The unit was sprayed before we came and we had to have it sprayed while we were staying there. Charlotte was quick to have the service come, but we still saw roaches and other bugs every day even after the spraying. If you're squeamish about bugs, this is not the place for you. 3) Charlotte sent me several messages in regards to issues with Airbnb processing my payments. Unfortunately, the credit card I rented the unit with was canceled due to fraud and Airbnb kept trying to charge it. I updated the payment information in their system and corrected the issue within minutes of notification. However, Charlotte still found it necessary to send me messages that were accusatory and offensive. She seemed overly concerned she would not be paid. Weird, considering Airbnb acts as 3rd party intermediary to prevent just such an issue. 4) The unit has a very clear statement that the renter is on the hook for the A/C cost in the summer and that the unit is metered. However, when it came time to pay that bill, Charlotte yet again sent me messages that accused me of overusing their electricity, yet had no metered bill for that unit to produce for me. She told me I owed her $185 for the month for the increased usage. However, when I asked how she came up with this number she had no real documentation to prove it. I could have paid her nothing, but instead, I paid her the requested $185 plus extra because I'm not the kind of guy who would ever short someone on a bill. 5) I found the bed to be extremely uncomfortable. Maybe it's just a personal preference...",2017-09,-0.5662,2713,2,0.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

Prior to our arrival I text John with no response and had to call twice before I could reach him to confirm the access code. During our conversation he notified me that his dogs are staying on the property and he would be the following night.  This detail was not on the listing when we booked and was added after we stayed here.  When we arrived at the house the dogs were in the laundry room (accessed from garage) and I called John to confirm that we rented the entire house and to ask if we needed to feed the dogs. He informed me that his neighbor would be coming by to feed them.  We are dog lovers and we felt very sorry for these dogs home alone with the owner out of town and gave them fresh water. After going out for dinner we returned to the house - about 5 minutes later the dogs startled my mother - we did not realize they had come inside while we were gone through the laundry room. Our dogs started scrapping but we were able to separate. The house overall was not clean :master bedroom sheets had stains that had not been washed; lacked fresh towels; dusty; bugs/flies in pantry and throughout house. The mattresses in the 3rd br were very hard. I had to use my body weight (125 lbs) to enter the front door because it sticks pretty bad. The neighbor came through a door in the backyard (without letting us know) to feed the dogs but turned around when he saw us. There was a note on the kitchen counter from the previous guests so we do realize that John had not been in the house since those guests had stayed there (about a week or so I think). We feel that John should have had someone check the house prior to our stay to ensure it was cleaned. When John arrived Saturday we expressed our concerns but there was no solution offered.  John smoked in the garage that night and we could smell it in the house. We had to monitor our dogs in the backyard because the dogs were barking at each other through the fence that separates the yard (all dogs being territorial).  Had we known of the dogs & John staying on the property we would not have booked here. We looked into leaving during our stay but could not find dog-friendly availability.    We came to Austin to attend a classic car show my Father had been looking forward to for months.  This was supposed to be a relaxing getaway weekend for my parents (one is caretaker and one has cancer) but was very stressful, uncomfortable and disappointing.

One shower only sends a fraction of the water to the shower head, with the rest coming out of the bath faucet. The other shower was completely clogged so that you stand in 4-5 inches of water while you shower. <br/><br/>Check in and check out are a major pain in the ass. The ""garage"" remote is stored inside the unit, so you have to either pay for parking to run up and find the remote yourself, or have somebody circle the block for however long it takes you to find the unit - which could be awhile because there is absolutely zero rhyme or reason to the numbering system. Units 349 and 350 are on different floors with several units in between them, etc. <br/><br/>The remote situation ended up being a problem for checkout, too - because you have to go through the same process of taking your car OUT of the garage area and parking out side just to run back up 3 floors to drop the remote off again before you leave. I checked, and the owner DID send me a message through the app the day before explaining the issue, but I didn't read it in time and ended up getting stuck in the garage for half an hour until I saw somebody else in the parking lot who was nice enough to go up to their unit, bring their remote downstairs, and allow me to leave. This particular point just seems absolutely insane to me - that you have to have a remote that belongs in the apartment to LEAVE the property. There should be no scenario that could end with a tenant sitting in the car HOPING somebody wants to leave at the same time as you.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another point. I was given two contact numbers to call if I had any issues (which I obviously did), and out of the 6 attempts to call these numbers over three days, not a single one was answered or returned. <br/><br/>The benefit to this place is that it has a lot of beds and it's a couple of blocks from Sixth Street, but that's about it.

I read other people's reviews, and accepted the host's acknowledgement that you can hear the noise from the unit above this apartment, and even brought earplugs. However, I did not anticipate that this noise would occur throughout the entire night. It is a creaky floor above the unit the reacts to anyone walking around, and of course to items being dropped. The first night at this location was fine, the second however, was awful. I ended up moving from the bed into the living room on the couch, thinking that the person above might not walk above this area, but was wrong- noise was just as bad. When the owner went outside and turned on the car lights around 4am, I told him it was so loud, and he let me know he was up packing for an early flight. <br/><br/>If you know that noise is an issue, and someone is paying to stay at your apartment, a waiver does not excuse simple courtesy and I would hope that a host would do their best to minimize noise during reasonable sleeping hours of say 11 to 5 at least. No such luck here. I was so disappointed, and it made for a very hard next day, with no sleep. If you can sleep through anything, then this could be a good option.

A previous user summed it up as ""not the type of place you would want to walk around barefoot in"" and I'd have to agree. The floors were pretty dirty. There are holes everywhere, in the floor (one in the bathroom where you can see the ground and foundation), holes in the walls  (covered by paper plates) and holes in bedroom (plugged by paper towels). The whole building likely needs an hvac and electrical overhaul, as there were power strips, cords, space heaters and wires everywhere. When we arrived there, it was like a Febreze bomb had gone off, the smell so overwhelming I was tasting and choking on it. I opened all the doors in an attempt to air out the space, but it definitely lingered, and I'm not sure what other odor might have previously existed that required covering up so extensively.  The ""backyard"" was like a communal area where there were multiple cars parked daily. Also, there was a regular stream of random men everywhere that didn't introduce themselves- doing chores, painting, like they all lived there (maybe in the teepee?) If I were a woman staying here alone, I definitely wouldn't feel comfortable, as there is limited privacy. Overall, I got a sense that this place was where either a lot of dudes lived, or a place where a lot of dudes crash. Chris himself said he was coming to meet us upon arrival, but we waited around an hour and then decided to just go get lunch because we were starving. He showed up afterwards with a brief rundown of “how the heater works” followed by a rapid fire list of suggested things to do.  In conclusion, I don't think I will be returning to the SoCo Cottage, next time I'm probably going to seek out something more traditional like the Motel on South Congress, the price is similar & the location just as convenient.",2014-04,-0.5508,1930,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

If you expect quality service and amenities, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Our group stayed here for nearly two weeks for a long conference at the convention center. On the plus side, the location was very convenient. And to be fair, my bed was comfortable. But our frustrations kept piling up. After we arrived, the remote to the parking garage only worked to get us into the building. But we couldn't get out. I talked with Ryan, who said there was a spare on the wall of the parking garage and we could get batteries to fix it. Alas, no spare. Fortunately a kind neighbor opened the gate for us--otherwise, the five of us would have been stuck inside. We bought the special batteries for the gate (at our expense) but the remote was still broken. We did have a new one when we returned that night. The next morning, as we were eating breakfast, the maid walked into the condo (no knocking. just unlocked the door and came in). She was bewildered that we were there -- and we were bewildered as well -- and wondered if the place had indeed been cleaned before we arrived. While the beds were made, there were dust bunnies and hair in the bathrooms and bedrooms. We told Ryan about our concerns of cleanliness, but he assured us it had been cleaned. In addition, only one of the remotes for the TVs worked -- Ryan said he had just replaced all the batteries the week before. But one didn't even have any batteries (or a battery cover). Two of the metal legs of the spiral staircase loudly vibrated every time the air conditioner came in (which also, to be fair, worked really well). We ended up shimmying the legs with some toothpicks to stop the noise. The kitchen was not very well appointed -- very limited glasses and bowls. The dishwasher was not completely attached to the countertop so every time we opened it, the entire machine dipped forward and threatened to fall out. On our third day, the security system started ringing in the middle of the night (again, a battery issue). And on our fourth day, we started hearing a very high-pitched noise coming from the laundry room. After a few hours of trying to figure out the problem (and even sending Ryan a video with sound of the issue), we finally discovered a smoke alarm sitting on a shelf (again the battery was dead). This was on the Fourth of July and after some texts with Ryan, he asked us not to contact him again. Don't worry. We didn't. The type of service he promises in this ad is not what he delivers.

Keep in mind, we are all from Seattle and are very accustomed to wlaking around day and night and the people/events we see. Anyway, I was with two 25 year old men who did not feel comfortable walking around the neighborhood at night. As a woman, I was very scared walking around the neighborhood WITH a man. It is a couple minute walk away from a main road, where you would totally feel safe/fine to walk around. You can tell the neighborhood is up and coming, but this part was definitely pretty rough. In fact, every single one of our uber drivers mentioned that we shouldn't be walking around the area and that we were just 2 streets away from ""the projects"". The dogs next door also barked constantly and it was difficult to sleep later than probably 5/6am. There are plenty of homeless people roaming the streets. I know this is a harsh review, but I'm saying these thing to help others. This area is not safe for families, young children, women, and some men even. I'm really sorry to be so harsh. I just need to warn people because I was not properly warned. The location is technically close to downtown, so that was nice.<br/><br/>It is an okay quality house, but has mostly updated things and a nice interior, so it was fine for a rental.

And there was half-eaten food in the fridge, which is pretty gross too…<br/>Also, there were a number of things that needed to be repaired…  my son (who is in his late 20’s) had such a backache from sleeping in the bed in the front room (some of the slats were missing, so it sagged badly), that he got up one night, found a screwdriver, and moved slats from the foot of the bed to the part that supports your torso!  Also, the towel rod was broken off the wall in the bathroom (so there was no where to hang your towel out), the door to the laundry was broken, and the yard and the back deck needed to have leaves cleared up so badly, that we couldn’t use the back deck at all.

We had two days of cold showers. Including one night when the water did not stop running (Christina reimbursed us for that night). When it comes to the upkeep of the property, the front gate would not close (had to use our own bungee cord to keep it shut) and the bathroom door did not fully close. Christina was very responsive to these issues and promptly contacted plumbers and fumigators. Christina denied our request for a partial reimbursement (beyond the night when the water from the shower ran all night).

Although the location is very good, the building is not nice and you have to walk up 2 flights of stairs to get to the unit. <br/><br/>The biggest issues were that the entire time we were there (4 nights), there was no working WIFI. The host said they share two WIFI hotspots with 121 units, which might explain why it was so slow as to be completely unusable, though half the time the hotspots were not even visible. We had to go to Starbucks to use WIFI every day. The second major issue is that the Air conditioning unit in the apartment is not strong enough to cool the apartment.

Finally, the towel in one of the bedroom was stained brown and should never have been left for us to use and one of our guests fell through the bed in the middle of the night because some of the wood slats under the bed were missing and others were not aligned and none of them were screwed in.  <br/><br/>We reported the issues with the WIFI and the temperature every day, and neither was resolved.

The owners are nice people and their daughter is adorable, but I do not feel they should be leasing this place in its current condition as marketed. *<br/><br/>My mom and I are both professional landlords. We didn’t expect luxury or frills. But we expected a place that met the bar of the description and photos, and a host who took tangible pride in the property.<br/><br/>Key issues encountered:<br/>- Photos do not capture current property condition whatsoever, and appear to be digitally blurred/masked to look nice. House interior had exceptional deferred maintenance and felt to be in extremely poor condition relative to asking price.<br/><br/>- All bedroom windows appeared inoperable (painted shut) - I couldn’t open a single one - unsafe in fire, probably a code violation. Air conditioning thermostat didn’t work, so house was scorching overnight.<br/><br/>- Safety: A big stone in the front porch steps is broken off. We did not see any working porch lighting. My mom nearly slipped twice in the tub (no safety mat or anything).<br/><br/>- Sanitation: Dirty oven and fridge (containing someone else’s food). Bathroom sink filter was filthy and blocked the drain. Cockroach ran around my bedroom at night (uncorrected rear exterior door threshold gap is excessive, enough for creatures to easily walk in). My mother was constantly itching all night.<br/><br/>- Noise: Airplanes going by until midnight, resuming 05:00.  Loud music from nearly drivers all night, easily every 15 minutes. <br/><br/>- Neighborhood: Low-income neighborhood with minimal-to-no signs of visible gentification. When we came, there were piles of literal garbage on everyone’s yards. Not exactly a nice place to walk around. (Hosts were mostly upfront about this by private message, and we were peachy with that.)<br/><br/>As a landlord, I know things are never perfect. While the host was outwardly nice, he didn't seem to get airbnb hosts have material and specific responsibilities towards guests.<br/><br/>- When my mom pointed out move-in cleanliness issues, he did not even enter the property to inspect or correct.<br/><br/>- When we e-mailed major concerns at 2:30 AM and several times throughout the weekday morning, we did not hear anything until literally 12:05 PM.<br/><br/>- When we decided we were moving out and wanted a refund for remaining days, he felt it was unfair that we held his family financially accountable, asserting that nothing is “broken” or “unsafe”, that we were expecting a “manicured” home, and the real issue apparently was with us: he requires tenants who are “unfussy”. (!)<br/><br/>- After this experience, we also received a request by text message to not leave them a review “and certainly not an unfavorable one”.<br/><br/>Considering staying here still? Demand precise status updates on above issues, and insist on unblurred, current photos.

There are a lot of things that were red flags immediately beginning with my stay, but I was genuinely willing to overlook them. The gate to the backyard is tiny and easily able to be accessed and opened. Being on a busy street, this was a little concerning, but even more so when paired with the fact that the door to the camper doesn’t shut completely. Anyone could easily open the gate to the backyard and to the camper with no problem whatsoever. I’ve seen other reviews stating that they felt unsafe and I’d have to agree and would like to emphasize that more than anything as something I really wish was brought to my attention before booking. The yard which the camper is located is trashed. Paint cans, weights, various trash is just strewn across the yard. The bathroom is in a shed that is piled high with just junk and dirty mattresses. The bed was unstable and shifted as if you’d broken it every time you moved on it and the fridge wasn’t cold at all and still had items in it from either previous campers or the host. Not at all like how the pictures looked in regard to cleanliness. We were notified that the AC had gone out an hour before we were supposed to check in but we would be provided a portable AC unit, which we were very understanding about, things happen. Upon arriving the camper was hot, so hot that it was almost impossible to breathe unless sitting directly in front of the portable unit. ALL of these things we were willing to overlook UNTIL at night when a cockroach the size of my palm flew directly at my face. At that point, I had had enough and my partner and I promptly packed our bags and sat in my car for 2 hours at 10:30 pm contacting airbnb support to help us find another place to stay. While this was happening, the host decided to not be helpful, but further escalate the situation by sending a passive aggressive message about how I “don’t know about biology” and stating that cockroaches have no ties to overall cleanliness. At that moment, we cancelled the trip and had to find somewhere else to stay at 12:30 at night. We didn’t even last a night there. Overall, a completely terrible experience and the treatment we received from the host was absolutely ridiculous. Do not stay here.",2021-07,-0.5299,2388,4,360.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

3386939,357117820,2018-12-09,2442719,Niav,"Given that Amina's place is listed as Signature Plus, we were sadly disappointed with what we found. First off, the studio was difficult to find. I arrived on a rainy evening and had to walk around in the dark and rain for 10 minutes trying to find the place. The studio is tucked behind the house and accessible on a different street from the actual address behind a carport (which wasn't clearly stated). I had to walk through a dark carport to get to the studio. There was no light left on either inside nor outside the studio, which made finding it extremely unclear. At one point, I called the host for assistance but she did not answer nor call me back. After some frustration, I finally found the place.<br/><br/>The second and bigger disappointment was with the general quality of Amina's studio. At first glance the place seems high quality and posh, but once we looked deeper, we were met with one disappointment after the next:<br/>1. There was no hot water (only lukewarm) the first night I arrived when all I wanted was a hot bath<br/>2. There was what appeared to be black mold or some kind of black stains in the grout in both the bathtub as well as the shower<br/>3. The towels were skimpy and several had large bleach stains on them<br/>4. The bath products provided were low quality<br/>5. The sheets on the kind bed were poor quality. The top sheet barely fit the bed. It was more like a queen top sheet on a king bed.<br/>6. There was rancid oil left out in a white porcelain bottle by the stove (which I unknowingly used - gross!)<br/>7. There was only one sauté pan in the entire kitchen and the handle was broken off<br/>8. Some of the blinds didn't work properly<br/><br/>There was a general feeling of tiredness and lackluster to the studio, like it was well worn but not adequately attended to.<br/><br/>For a Signature Plus property, we had much higher expectations than we would for a normal Airbnb. Sadly, this place was disappointing even for a normal Airbnb. Unless Amina attends to some of the wear and tear issues and up levels the linens and bath products, I can't recommend this place, especially as Signature Plus property.<br/><br/>To Amina's defense, she seems like a nice person. We really didn't have much contact with her throughout the weekend.

Additionally, I did not include my 6 year old daughter in the number of people staying but told the host that three of us would be there.

Owner comes in taking pics of all the guest in the house. Pics of the decor and said no strong alcohol when the bottles she was taking pics of were part of decor. As family was coming she comes out demanding more money saying she doesn’t feel safe because of our guest and us being people of color.

However, the place was quite dirty with ware in the bathroom, dirty dishes in the oven, dust and crumbs under the couch, and a napkin that turned black when wiping the floor due to a light water spill. The windows were easy to use, but the gigantic bathroom window that provides a view of the showers and toilet was tied in such a way that it could not be reached to close without a ladder. Additionally, there were no smoke detector in the main rooms, but instead a visible spot where one was previously connected with wires hanging from the ceiling. There was one smoke detector in the hallway, but it would be one of the last places smoke would reach.<br/>Another item I felt was odd were the location of the light switches as they were often on the opposite end of the room from the entrance, or behind the door you open to enter a room. <br/>When we had mentioned that the TV remote batteries were not working, the host provided batteries the next day, but those batteries were equally without power. <br/>When some complaints had been made about the status of the house, the host seemed dismissive as though these problems could be delegated to others. <br/>Lastly, upon opening the storage compartment in the couch, I found multiple loose pills.

While there was more ""room"" by square footage standards and number of bathrooms within the 2 units, it made our girls weekend seem not as cohesive.  We didn't want to be in 2 units, we wanted to be in 1.  They seemed to not get that, and said that we 'were better off"" because other reservations that had were forced to move to nearby hotels.  My question is, ""Why rent units when they aren't ready?""<br/><br/>The Littlefield Suite Building itself was under construction, and not nearing completion.  The balconies they advertised were not usable since there was no glass.   The common areas were dusty, and banging and drilling woke us up at 8:00 am on a Saturday.

3549253,764928663,2021-05-31,204689307,Michael,"We were disappointed with our stay at the Lodgewell. The primary issue was the price-value proposition, as well as the listing being misleading.<br/><br/>We had booked what was advertised as a 2 bedroom unit and paid more than $630 / night for our stay. This rate was equivalent to, if not higher than, several other hotels in the area, and based on the pictures of our unit, we had thought the property would be similar if not better than those hotel options.<br/><br/>The day before our check-in, I received a message from Lodgewell indicating that even though the listing was advertised as 2 bedroom, that the floor plan was ""open"" and there weren't going to be actual bedrooms. I had promptly asked to see if there were any units with 2 true bedrooms available in the building (and offered to pay more), and was told that there wasn't. The sleeping space was essentially entirely located on the second floor / loft floor. There was one bed at the top of the stairwell against a divot in the wall, with a curtain in front of it, and that was the only separation. The second bed was ~12-15 feet away, and against another divot in the wall, with no curtain. Neither of us felt that the arrangement could have reasonably be classified as a 2 bedroom unit, and the experience for all four nights simply felt as though we were sharing a 1 bedroom with two floors that happened to have 2 beds. This was extremely disappointing given the price we were paying to stay.<br/><br/>There were several other issues that while not as fundamentally upsetting as the bedroom issue, still contributed to the Lodgewell feeling like a less premium option, and certainly not a $600+ / night accommodation. These were:<br/><br/>1) Air conditioning was intermittent. I ran into a few other people who were staying in the Lodgewell who had also complained that their AC units didn't seem to always work, as well as one visitor who claimed his AC was entirely broken. Given the Austin weather, this felt unacceptable.<br/><br/>2) Check-in process. I had emailed the Lodgwell on May 9th (2.5 weeks prior to my check-in date) asking if we could check-in earlier (from 3pm to 1pm), given our flight was landing around then. A staff member emailed me back saying that we could either pay a $100 fee to check in two hours earlier, or wait until the day before our check-in, at which point they could let us know if we would be able to check in at 1pm. They explained that if nobody else rented the room the night before our check-in date, we would be able to check in early - this was totally reasonable. On May 25th, two days before our check-in date, I contacted the property again, asking to confirm whether our early check-in would be approved. A staff member responded by saying I would be contacted by phone / text on May 26th confirming. Through the same communication channel (Airbnb message), I followed up on May 26th asking to confirm. Nobody from Lodgewell ever responded to me. On May 27th, after asking an unrelated question via Airbnb, the Lodgewell let me know that an early check-in would not be possible. At this point, we had already arrived at the facility, which had no staff members in the lounge. Given May 26th was a work day and given the pandemic, this significantly disrupted our ability to work (no Wifi, no sit-down common areas). We were highly disappointed that earlier notice wasn't given so that we could look for accommodations between noon and 3pm in advance, particularly since presumably the Lodgewell would have known at least a day in advance if nobody (or somebody) was staying in our room that night. I had also asked that at the very least, we be allowed to leave our luggage somewhere in the lobby for safekeeping until our check-in was ready, and was told we couldn't do that either. Nobody had ever contacted me to let us know when check-in was ready (we were told somebody would let us know). <br/><br/>3) Common Areas / General Amenities. The elevator button often didn't work, and the elevator itself was cramped, fitting just 2-3 people comfortably, which was upsetting given the pandemic. Additionally, the elevator itself had a strong odor to it for all four nights of our stay, and consistently would have spilled food / drink on the already limited floor space.  One night, the hallway of our floor had a jar of spilled queso / cheese - this was never cleaned during our stay. In our room, there was only one small ~32"" TV. The outlets on the first floor did not work.<br/><br/>4) The entrance to the Lodgewell is a small door, somewhat hidden / tucked away into the corner of a wall. Most nights, there were multiple homeless people who would loiter next to, near, or sometimes blocking the door. This seemed like a potential safety hazard.<br/><br/>Overall, the price we paid for our rooms was fully disconnected to the experience and quality of our stay. The lack of real bedrooms had already felt misleading and alone made the price tough to swallow, especially when benchmarked against nearby hotels and Airbnb's. The additional grievances and lack of on-site staff to address or speak to regarding those issues all further contributed to a below par experience.",2021-05,-0.5316,5194,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

She was fun to talk to and recommended lots of good places to visit.  <br/>That said, I have to comment on the house.  This is an old, shabby place that has not been well maintained.  The kitchen drawers don’t have runners to keep them from falling out.  The kitchen counter was made using tiles; now, the grout is shot, tiles are missing or broken, all making it very unsanitary.  The toilet sounds like an air raid siren for 30 to 40 seconds when flushed.  Whoever painted it, long ago, did so without use of masking tape or even a wet sponge to wipe up splatters.  The many things that have been attached and removed from the walls have left holes that have not been repaired or repainted.  There are no thresholds to transition from the concrete floors to the tiled floors.  The grout in the shower and around the toilet should be cleaned and resealed.  The mirror in the bathroom is so old and speckled, it’s hard to see  yourself in it.  The sheers over the table in the living room are too narrow for the windows and don’t offer any privacy.  The sheers in the master bedroom are so sheer; there’s no room darkening or privacy.  Despite the appearance in the photo, the patio area is not accessible from inside the unit.  It’s off to the side of the house.    <br/>Overall, we found the house uncomfortable.  One bed was made from two box springs with a 1 1/2” foam pad.  The other was a cheap box spring with a thin pad built into it.  Both were uncomfortable to sleep on.  The living room has two old love seats but no footstools, side or coffee tables.  The TV only has a Chrome device on it for signal.  If you don’t have the app on your device, then you get nothing. <br/>Without verifying that she has addressed the comments noted above, I would not recommend saying here.<br/>",2016-02,-0.6003,1949,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

We chose Kristine's place because of the price and the proximity to our property, but I do wish we'd have done some more research before choosing to book. The property wasn't very clean, there were piles of old dog poop in the grassy area out front, the property is 1/2 of a detached duplex and other renters use the other property so there's a lot of traffic and noise. Kristine was great in letting use bring our pets for an additional cleaning fee, but after entering the place I can't really tell if the original cleaning fee was really all that utilized. The floors were really dirty, like layers of visible grime everywhere, the oven, cabinets, and drawers were in some kind of terrible barely functioning order, and the toilet seat was broken and would pinch your leg every time you sat down.

I had to sleep with the ugly, filthy sectional pushed against the front door so nobody could break in.

While it was clean and the rental process was pretty well organized, there were a number of things about it that were okay to bad.  First of all, I was not expected to have to fill out reams of paperwork after booking through Airbnb.  It was a hassle and not what I've experienced other places.  It was only when I read the ""house rules"" more closely that I discovered the rental was located in a very noisy area - something that should definitely be included in the apartment description.  Telling me that a ""house rule"" is that I accept nighttime noise is totally not acceptable; it was critical that I get a good night sleep after flying all day so I would be prepared for a big presentation in the AM, but I would have had to forfeit my deposit of several hundred dollars to change my booking.  So I was stuck with this one.  And indeed, it was LOUD on Friday and Saturday nights.  The place has no ventilation to speak of, so it started to smell bad after a little while.  The only way to get any air circulation in the apartment is by opening the patio doors in the bedroom - there's no fan in the kitchen, the living room windows don't open, there's no fan in the bathroom, and no windows in either bedroom, the kitchen, or the bathroom.  I tried to contact the hosts the night before checkout to inquire about storing my bags somewhere because my flight didn't leave until late at night the next day, but got no response until I was on my way to the airport (having carried them around all day).   There were some nice touches like free chips, but the whole setup is faux-personal - lots of laminated booklets, forms, etc.  From what I can tell, the whole floor is made up of identical apartments being rented by the same company through Airbnb so it feels like a hotel.

I called airbnb and they said there is no additional charges for my kids, it was't in the contract when I book the trip, so he change the terms later knowing that he capitalize the situation.

I couldn’t sleep that night and the next day I cancelled for the night. I feel like the listing is accurate as far as the photos go, but due to being being ghosted on by the host, I can not recommend this place. <br/><br/>Also, there aren’t locks on the doors upstairs which is concerning considering that there are other guests staying in other rooms listed.

This is an old home, and perhaps our expectations were out of line with reality, but when we showed up, the curtains were drawn, shutters closed, and ac turned off on a 94 degree day.  Inside the house was around 80 degrees and the house was very stuffy and smelled musty.  Additionally, the listing advertised a smart TV, that when attempted to use, did not work, which is a little challenging when you're trying to get settled and have a 3 year old.  The owner did offer come over and bring a different TV, which was appreciated, but was still an inconvenience none the less.  My wife suffers from bad allergies, particularly to mold, and because we didn't want to risk it with the musty smell, we ended up checking into a hotel instead.  When we informed the owner, they offered for us to look at some of their other rentals, which was appreciated, but said offer came a few hours after we informed them of the smell and that we were planning on leaving.  At that point in the night, it was too late to look at the other options, especially with a 3 year old, and we elected to stay at the hotel.  When we informed the owner that we wouldn't need any of their other rentals, there was no further communication, which I believe is in poor taste considering we were unhappy with the accommodations.  I understand that we may be pickier than most, and we booked the hotel knowing that we would most likely not get any relief in terms of a refund, but that said, we feel like the owner should have handled the situation more delicately and with a little more consideration of our inconvenience and cost burden.

I just got a  link that morning with a long house manual which I intended to read at the house since I have been driving for 8 hours and didn’t get a chance to read it fully.

The place was beautiful and check in was easy, but during the day the air conditioning units were unable to keep the place cool, especially in the bedroom area. Our guest chose last minute to bring his wife, and she communicated with me about it saying that they were very uncomfortable and wanted to leave the trailer and stay at a different location. I immediately reached out to Sara and let her know what their concerns were. It was 6:45pm and I needed to hear back from her immediately because I had to either get the AC issue fixed or find them another place to stay — and their preference was to go elsewhere. But there was no response. Sara didn’t pay attention to her phone for 5 hours! I sent numerous messages on the Airbnb app, and I called and texted her phone directly because she had provided the number and said to text with any questions. When she finally did respond at 11:45 pm, she didn’t acknowledge any of my frustration with trying to reach her or apologize for the extreme delay, she only said, “The ac is fine” and proceeded to defend the temperature she found in that moment which was “in the 70s”….?? By then it was too late! Since I hadn’t heard from her, I had already booked another location so my guests would have someplace to go after the concert. And Sara took ZERO responsibility for abandoning her post as the host! The only thing she did right was to give us a partial refund for the days that our guests wouldn’t be there. Airbnb wasn’t available to help that night, either! So we were completely on our own. It was extremely disappointing, and we have decided based on how poor Airbnb’s customer service was, this will be the last time we use this app.",2022-07,-0.9595,1800,3,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

My registration is under my business email but for some reason I had to put in a personal email, so all the AirBnB reservation emails came through my business email yet sporadic correspondence from the rental agency came to my personal email. After a few back and forth emails we got everything ironed out. I did have an issue with the parking. Although it is buried in the fine print I discovered parking was not included and it was $30 a day. What started as a room rate of $85 escalated to a $350 two night stay. $70 for cleaning I think is just a pure profit grab. Not trying to sound “one-percent-er” but I pay twice that for a house four times that size. Again, it’s just the comparison that I can base the value on. $40 service fee, I guess i got my money’s worth on this one. I had a late check-in and an engagement to attend, so I was a little pressed for time. I decided to take a quick shower and before I could get the water to the right temperature to transfer the water to the shower head it went cold. I called and their recommendations were: make sure the H and C valves are correct. Sometimes the H is C and C is H, and, we have this problem sometimes and you should cycle the breaker, sometimes it shows it’s on but it’s really tripped... isn’t this a code violation for breakers not to work properly? Fires start because of this very reason. Anyways... she said this will fix it but to call back in 30 minutes if there is still a problem and they will send someone. I told them to go ahead and send someone but make it after 12pm because I wanted to sleep in. so I guess the reason for my problem was because I assumed the breaker flip would fix the problem but wouldn’t be able to shower until after noon if it didn’t. The next morning I get up to shower and have the exact same problem. Now I’m pissed because I have to use a wash cloth to close the drain (it’s been disconnected), keep my heel pressed against it so the 2” of warm water I was able to collect would allow me to wash myself and shampoo my hair. My call after my bird bath was met with resistance, interruptive and argumentative responses. The reason I had to take a bird bath was because I didn’t call after thirty minutes and I scheduled the service call for after noon. So it was my own fault. It got to the point I had to raise my voice and tell her to stop interrupting me. They sent a service guy up who said the exact same thing: flip the breaker and turn the thermostat up.

That night. To which she responded “probably not”.  She did not communicate this prior at any part of the day. <br/>I am a young woman who has never visited TX and who has no family or friends there. <br/>That night she left I decided to stay there bc finding a hotel in the middle of a blackout was nearly impossible. <br/><br/>That night a man tried breaking into her apt. <br/><br/>Prior to this I had a terrible gut feeling and I was scared so a chair was placed under the main entrance doorknob which didn’t allow the man to enter As the doorknob wouldn’t turn.

The most important thing to note is that it really isn't a two-bedroom apartment. There's a bed in the living room. I mean, you could see it as a two-bedroom with no living room. In any case you either have no common area, or you're using one of the bedrooms as a common area. The kitchen is small and very poorly equipped. Old cheap cookware and no spices (not even pepper when we arrived - only salt). That being said there was very good coffee and a coffeemaker, which was nice. Although to add on that, there was old moldy coffee in the maker. The place wasn't clean when we arrived, and Kevin apologized because they turned over the place quickly. It wasn't horrific - there were clean linens etc, but stuff like the old coffee, and parts of the apartment that clearly hadn't been swept or dusted for a long time. The bathroom was terrible - the tub was just disgusting and didn't drain. After a couple of minutes, you'd be ankle-deep in water. If two people wanted to shower, you'd have to wait a considerable time in between the showers, or stand in the other person's dirty water. There was no shelf space for any toiletries, and one hook for a towel.<br/><br/>Again, I don't feel good about writing bad reviews, but nearly everything about this place was bad. The location wasn't even really good - the neighborhood was OK (it used to be the poor side of town but it's kind of up-and-coming) but you're certainly not walking distance to the city. This would be OK as a crash-pad if it was, say, half the price (it's over $100 per night as of the writing of this review), but compared to other places I've stayed with Airbnb, this was far below the quality I'm used to in every regard.

5375637,40336471,2015-07-30,1156698,Mary,"My family rented Holly’s apt for 5 weeks.  Before I agreed to rent this apt I spoke with Holly via email and telephone informed her that we were partially on vacation, but the majority of the time we would be working remotely from her apt. We needed internet and a quiet environment to take work related calls and meetings.  She assured me everything was in working order in her unit and there would be no issues.<br/> <br/>Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.  During my stay, I contacted Holly several times with concerns or issues that she did not disclose of before I rented this property. I felt she was annoyed and dismissive.  All in all, the conditions of her unit were poor and host was not forthcoming about the issues we would encounter during our stay.  Had we known all of these issues beforehand we would not have agreed to rent this unit.<br/> <br/>1. Washer:  A few days prior to my arrival Holly informed me that her washer has not been working properly. The drum on the Washer is broken causing it to make a really loud, unbearable noise.  The noise is so loud that you can't even hold a conversation, watch tv, or much less take work related calls while doing your laundry. <br/>2. Apt:  no hangers, dresser drawers were broken, dining chairs are flimsy, and the ad said cable TV, there is no cable.<br/>3. Bug Infestation: Apt was infested with centipedes and bugs.  I killed between 30 - 40 centipedes a day; crawling on ceilings, walls, furniture, beds, floors, everywhere. I contacted the host and she said she didn't know how to get rid of them and that she thought they were entering her unit because of the rains.  It rained 4 days out of my entire trip.  She could've hired an exterminator. <br/>4. Roofers:  host texted me that roofers would be fixing a leak and it would not disturb me.  I told her it would absolutely disturb us because we are working from her home and the loud banging and hammering would interrupt our day.  I asked her to be sensitive to our work schedule.  She said it was out of her control and could not tell me the day and time they were coming so I could rearrange my schedule and calls. She asked me to call the roofers myself to reschedule. When I refused she rescheduled to after I left. The roofers showed up while I was still in the apt and started during our morning conference calls. <br/>5. Cat: ad said she has a cat living in her unit that was self-sufficient; only needed food and water.  I was ok with that.   Holly left me a long list of instructions to care for her cat.  She asked me to feed him, brush him, apply flea treatment, and apply a medication to his nose. I never agreed to be her cat's sitter.  She did not disclose this beforehand.

When I asked to be compensated for a main feature of the Airbnb being missing I was basically laughed at and told no way. Then the ceiling split open and started leaking water which continued for the duration of our stay. The upstairs bedroom carpet was sopping wet the entire time we were there because of this leak. He ended up sending me $150 back I guess as compensation for the leak which was a laughable amount for what we dealt with and I will be requesting a much larger refund via Airbnb. The apartment is also very dark and we couldn’t find a way to turn on the upstairs bedroom lights or the main livingroom light. The main shower for the apartment is either scalding hot or cold.

Wasn't made clear on what we could use in the home: (kitchen utensils, phone chargers, restroom toiletries?) Seemed like the owner kept all their personal stuff in its place.

There's inadequate trash bins on premise only 2 tiny itty bitty cans and no city trash bin outside, it needs appropriate trash disposal especially when you're cooking and bringing to-go food home the whole weekend. We had to put the trash in bags outside for sanitary reasons. In the pictures it appears the second bedroom has a bed but it's a mattress on the floor with a worn holes blanket over it.

Also, all the randomly stuffed closets and broken things go beyond cleaning crew issues, just saying.<br/><br/>Location was great otherwise and it had enough room for two people (no more than that).

6260941,63922447,2016-02-28,56227680,Marya,"We stayed here for two nights in March, 2016.   The apartment is not as advertised.  It is not ""bright and cosy"".  It is dingy and depressing. The windows were dirty, with cobwebs, both inside and out.  The apartment (one of two in the house) faces north and is poorly lit even during the day and especially at night.  Not all the interior lights were working. There is a smell of mildew and mold throughout the unit.  The sheets for the pullout bed were mismatched castoffs and the comforters on both beds were polyester.  The vinyl laminate floors are of low quality and not pleasant on bare feet.  (They are cold and clammy). The front porch was dirty, unswept, and in need of paint.  There was a For Rent sign on the front lawn which invited strangers to peer in the windows and contributed to a feeling of insecurity. The owner did not remove the sign during our stay despite my concern about it.<br/><br/>The apartment is not located near the main attractions of the city and so you need a car to get around.<br/><br/>The cost in Canadian dollars for two nights was $573 (after including the $115 cleaning fee and the $75 AirB&B booking fee.)     At this price, the experience should be similar to a stay in a high quality hotel, not a college dorm.<br/><br/>In light of my complaints about the cleanliness of the unit, the owner waived the cleaning fee.

6539818,552852647,2019-10-22,899897,Melinda,"Well, this is easily the most difficult review I've ever written on Airbnb and it largely has nothing to do with the apartment itself so let's start with the good. The apartment is as described and the best feature is its location. It's within walking distance to almost anything in downtown Austin and very close to the state capitol, yet in a very quiet area. 2 of us stayed here for 2 nights and we had no problem with traffic noise, noise from neighbors, etc. Everything worked as it should and it's spacious enough for 2 people, though any more than that and you're going to be cramped. In addition to the bed, there is a small futon but it really only sleeps one person comfortably. We did encounter a few negatives: 1) the place could really use a welcome manual. Something that lists the wifi info, how to work the cable TV, where extra anything is kept, etc. There was a small binder with a bunch of restaurant info (a print off from Goggle or some similar browser) and a copy of the welcome email Julia sent me, but that was it. 2) The bathroom door was installed at an angle and only closes if you slam it hard. It had a full length mirror hanging from it so we removed this, hoping that would solve the problem. It didn't. 3) Yes, the parking space is as bad as other reviews have stated. It's between a concrete pillar and a concrete wall and during our stay, a large SUV was parked directly across from the space, making it really hard to back up. We had a Toyota Corolla and a driver who can handle weird angles in tight spaces, but if you have anything bigger than a Corolla, I wouldn't try it. There were dings and marks all over the wall and pillar from other vehicles and if you're concerned about your vehicle fitting I took a few pics and can send them to you if you message me. Regardless, for our purposes, this place worked well, which is why I gave it any stars at all. Now, for the bad. I have booked numerous places through Airbnb over a period of 6 years in 4 countries. I have dealt with language barriers, hosts who work very demanding jobs, rentals in obscure places that require 4 pages of directions to locate, all manner of check in instructions, hosts in different time zones who live no where close to the rental-you name it. And yet, I've never before had a problem. I now realize that's because every other host I've ever dealt with had prioritized communication and treating their guests with common courtesy and respect. I can't say the same for Julia and without making this review into a novella, the issue I had with her was that she wasn't going to send the check-in instructions for the rental until the day we checked in. Fine if you have a smart phone, I guess, but I do not (yes, I know that's rare. Still a fact) and would be driving 10 hours the day we were set to check in. I had no way to access those instructions on the day we checked in and needed Julia to send them the day before, when I would have a wifi connection on my laptop. Prior to explaining this to Julia, she had responded to a message I sent her within 2 minutes of my sending it. When I asked if she could send the check in instructions early, I got no response. 24 hours later...nothing. I tried messaging her again...nothing. Calling...nothing. Had to get Airbnb support involved (first time I've ever had to do that!) and they couldn't reach her, either. Finally, after sending her a text basically asking if she was either dead or scamming me, I got my check-in instructions. No apology, no explanation, but whatever-I got what I needed. Problem solved, right? Nope. Get to Austin, exhausted, hungry, still stressed from trying to park the car without damaging it, lug all our bags to the second floor, go to punch in the key code she gave me in the check-in instructions and...nothing. I don't have a smart phone but I do have a cell phone so I called Julia and within seconds she picks up. And wouldn't you know it? She must've forgot and given me the wrong code! And, gee, she also told me to turn the handle the wrong way in her check-in instructions, which meant I could've punched in as many codes as she threw at me-I would never have gotten in since I was basically locking and re-locking the door with each turn. Now, this could have been an honest mistake. Things happen, issues slip our minds. And had Julia treated me with any kind of courtesy at all prior to this little front door debacle I probably would've chalked it up to that. But I don't believe her ignoring me for nearly 72 hours was a coincidence and I don't think I was given the wrong code and instructions by mistake. In my day to day life, I work with strangers all day long so I know that sometimes people behave in ways that have nothing to do with you. Maybe there are issues in Julia's life I know nothing about that caused her to treat me this way-maybe I was a convenient target, I don't know. But what I do know is that I don't go on vacation to get stressed out and treated like I don't even exist. In all the time I have been using Airbnb I have never encountered a host like this or a problem like this and the only good thing I can say is Airbnb support was awesome-fast, responsive and it was obvious they wanted to resolve my problem. I'll never know what was happening on Julia's end or why but despite not trying to take...",2019-10,-0.6738,5339,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

It is also not worth the price. There are way cooler places in more hip neighborhoods in this price range. <br/><br/>THE GOOD: <br/>Had all the amenities you could need. Internet works great. The A/C unit works well. The bed is comfy. Robert was cool enough to leave water, coffee and beer. <br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>The location is not the greatest. It is about 1.5mil from the Meuller development which has a Starbucks and a grocery store. However it is at least a 15 min drive to anywhere cool. It is very 'suburban' and does not have that Austin feel. You cannot walk to any cool restaurants/coffee shops. You will need a car (or Uber everywhere).  The neighborhood was kind of sketchy. I got hit up for change a few times by people on the corner.<br/>The neighbors also play Tejano music and sing really loudly at night. <br/><br/>THE UGLY: <br/>1. There are a lot of mosquitos in Austin right now (from all the rain from the TX hurricanes). They fly down the chimney at night- you can't kill them fast enough! (I had literally 100 bites from head to toe. 25 bites on just one foot/ankle!!) Robert suggested I ""wear bug spray at all times"" and that I buy a citronella candle. Didn't realize I was 'camping out'. <br/><br/>2. The house is old. It has a ""damp basement"" smell to it that lingers in your clothes. (Smelled like moldy basement to me). There are no windows to open in the living area to air it out, so you are trapped with that smell. (I had to wash all my clothes 2-3 times to get the smell out). <br/><br/>3. Mostly lit by skylights, so when the sun isn't out during the day, it's dark and depressing in the home. <br/><br/>4. I counted 6 dead roaches. Better than live ones-- but that just means that the home had been sprayed with toxic pest control chemicals. Maybe this is why I had respiratory problems and headaches the entire time I stayed there. <br/><br/>Robert seemed like a good host initially; however as soon as I had some issues, he quickly became uncooperative. I spent $1750 for a 1 month rental. I was not comfortable there and he would not issue any refund. He acted ""offended"" that I did not like the home's scent or the mosquito problem. He told me to ""just sweep the bugs up and move on"". He did offer a cleaning service to come-- however this was not the proper solution for the issues I was having.<br/><br/>I had to involve Airbnb for a partial refund since the owner was not willing to work with me.<br/>I highly suggest choosing another location in Austin if there are any available.",2017-10,-0.5669,2677,2,-17.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

It was as charming as the photo and parked behind a cute cottage on a shady street just a block from groceries, a great wine shop and stellar Tex-Mex at Maudie’s. (Plus a cheap, 10-minute Uber to downtown.) The host, Sarah, was friendly and informative and greeted us with an offer to share her lovely back yard and garden, even welcoming the guitar! Add in wildflower season and it made for a cool road trip on the back roads from Dallas.<br/><br/>Couple cautions: although we are comfortable with close quarters and pretty familiar with RV quirks and limitations…this was something of a challenge. Pay close attention to the floor plan provided on Airbnb. The bed is ample and as is the refrigerator, but be aware that nobody over 5’8” can stand up in the combination commode/shower area. My partner is 6’2”. Ouch. He was a good sport about it though.<br/><br/>Also be aware that the host has multiple signs posted that shoes are not allowed inside the Shasta, even though the floors are covered with mats. (?) I can maybe understand banning high heels or cowboy boots…but rubber soles? And there are no chairs outside the RV to sit on and take off shoes. We simply couldn’t figure this one out. By the time we crouched on the concrete back steps of the host’s house and walked to the Shasta, dirt and grass and gravel were stuck to our bare feet as opposed to much cleaner rubber soles. It was dirty and painful and what exactly was the point?<br/><br/>A more serious glitch: the waste tank filled before our minimum 5-night stay was up. We were only in the Shasta mornings and late at night, took our showers at our friend’s nearby condo, knew to simply evacuate the commode (first-time RV users sometimes hold down the water pedal too much). I can’t imagine how people who are going to be there all day and night wouldn’t fill up the tank in at least half the time. The end result was that on our last night, we got back late in the evening after my birthday dinner to no usable toilet. Our text to the host was answered by a flat ""No, I'm not home!"" and she didn't text us further about what to do or even when she would return…so we had to pack up and check into La Quinta at 1 a.m.  Not a great or cost-effective ending to our stay but maybe it’s all part of keeping Austin funky.

Stairs were challenging, different rise runs on each set, not to code, poorly lit so guessing the size of a step or drop step was difficult at night.  To get to the booked room you have to go up a set of stairs, then down a set of stairs, then up again.  Railing was lower than 36"" , creating a hazard given the other named issues with the stairs.  The pool water is murky and cloudy, and the area surrounding the pool was filled with old trashy sun baked furniture and floaties.  I booked with the intent of spending some time in the pool area, but was disappointed with the space and the condition. Interior was clean, but very dated, and smelled of weed when we arrived.  Bedding and bed were average, bad pillows (not the decorative ones, those were cute, but the ones you put your head on),  the bed was cheap/ rickety. The shower head didn't function - struggled to get water through the head with enough flow to shower.   The booking was overpriced, relative to the apartment complex environment and apartment amenities.

The stairs can be rough with luggage but we are middle aged and it was fine. It was a challenge checking in mostly because it was late night and pouring rain with thunder. However, the information about lock box was a little misleading. There is indeed a lock box which had the wrong code but they quickly answered the phone and reset the code so I could get the key. Actually, there was no need for a lock box or key since there was a numeric lock right on the door which worked fine with the original code and then the updated code. This was a little confusing but they were helpful and really for our room on the 3rd floor there was no need for a lock box anyway. Wireless was a little slow at times but they did have a second wireless network which my wife used with instructions in the room (different SSID and password).<br/> <br/>    I would stay again and rate them a solid 4+<br/><br/>Dave and Cindy",2021-10,-0.1207,1020,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

Since I'd explained my reason for the stay was post-surgery recovery, I'm not sure why Rita thought I'd be entering other homes in a loud and immodest fashion.

However, when I got there there were parts of the house that had not even been touched (I took photos to prove), the owner was there cleaning without a mask and gloves, so I had to disinfect the whole place myself. The shower was full of bugs before I used it. Plus there were knives in the drawer that were supposed to be clean and were covered in a sticky mess. The sponge was moldy and there wasn’t even a new one to replace it with. Yuck! Second, there is no mention in this listing that there is not a TV. Would be fine otherwise but during stay at home order, pretty inconvenient. Third, they do say that the oven does not work, however they claim to have a toaster oven. This is NOT true either.

With the other noise, this is low on the negatives list, but worth mentioning. <br/><br/>I have never had to submit a bad review to Airbnb, but unfortunately this one is warranted. If you want to party all weekend, loud drunk 20-somethings don’t bother you and sleeping is not on the agenda, this rental could work for you. Unfortunately for me and my guests, this was not the case.

This is an apartment block right downtown, and I mean RIGHT DOWNTOWN, Austin on 6th Street. Some of the apartments are privately owned, some rented on a long term basis, and some for sort term lets. Out unit, 508, was the last unit on the corridor next to the laundry room. I can highly recommend it as it is the furthest away from 6th Street noise that one can get.<br/>The ""host"", Chereen, was great in all matters, the apartment was as advertised. Everything provided as stated in the description. So no complaints at all.<br/>The only issue with the apartment is that there is only one bathroom, which can become inconvenient for 4+ people. Also, only the one bedroom is private, the other two sleeping areas are open - one immediately when you walk in, the other on the second floor outside the bathroom. If there are 2 couples, you have to know each other rather well...<br/>The noise from 6th Street can be disturbing, and earplugs are provided!<br/>Austin isn't a cheap place to visit, and this apartment was over $200/night.

There was definitely mold in the house but air bnb refused to inspect it, instead they claimed it was dirt without using any sort of official tool that can capture metrics about mold spore density. I am sensitive to mold, I could see it growing out of the vents, I don't think the support guy at air bnb knew what mold looks like. That being said I should have looked at the place in person before I rented it because it was clearly a dump.

BigRep ist Hersteller des weltweit größten 3D Druckers mit Hauptsitz in Berlin. Da wir mit 4 Personen unterwegs waren, hätte ein Hotelaufenthalt unser Budget gesprengt und somit haben wir uns für eine Airbnb Unterkunft entschieden. <br/>Ich muss gestehen, dass ich anfänglich, auf Grund der Lage etwas skeptisch war, da sich das Festival in Downtown befand. Aber bereits bei der Buchungsanfrage wurde ich von der Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft der Texaner und im speziellen von Kurt, unseren Vermieter, in den Bann gezogen. Die gesamte Vorabkommunikation verlief problemlos und sehr gastfreundlich. Kurt hat uns alle Informationen, wie Zugangspincode, Wifi Zugang, Hausordnung etc. vorab zukommen lassen. Somit mussten wir nicht einmal eine persönliche Übergabe vereinbaren, sondern konnten das Haus zum vereinbarten Termin einfach beziehen. Trotzdem stand Kurt jederzeit zur Verfügung und erkundigte sich, ob wir gut gelandet sind und alles unseren Vorstellungen entspricht. Als ich dann vor dem Haus stand und nach 14 Stunden Flug das Haus betrat, fühlte ich mich gleich total zu Hause.<br/>Das Haus ist mit 3 Schlafzimmern, 2 Bädern, einer großen Küche mit Insel und Wohnzimmer ausgestattet. Es ist sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und macht einen hochwertigen Eindruck. Die Küche war mit allem ausgestattet und somit bat sich die Möglichkeit selbst zu kochen. Nach einem vollen Arbeitstag ""nach Hause"" zukommen und sich frei bewegen zu können, mal mit den Kollegen im Garten zu sitzen und das gemeinsame Abendessen zu genießen, macht einen dienstlichen Auslandsaufenthalt so viel angenehmer.

Because we do not have a lot of experience with Airbnb's, we sought the opinions of friends and family to see if our expectations were unrealistic or whether we were on target about our issues. <br/><br/>There were some good points about the house. A yard as well as a small park across the street for our dog, a washer and dryer in the garage. Because our stay was lengthy, these were important factors for us. We stayed a total of 9 weeks. The location was good and the neighborhood was quiet. <br/><br/>I will not go into every single detail about what was wrong with the house.  But there are general and specific points that need to be made. It was old and not well taken care of, furniture was very dated, and it looked like everything had been around for awhile. Amenities were at a minimum; NO garage door opener (What!?) which is a huge hassle when you are coming and going all day long. They stored some of their personal belongings in the ONE car garage (bike, wood, etc.) which made it difficult for us to store our own stuff and park our car. Internet was 3 mb/s which made it pretty hard for my husband to work from the house. In our minds, although not exactly impressed by these factors and somewhat inconvenienced, we COMPLETELY understand that these are not issues that warrant a terrible review but certainly bring it down a couple of notches. HOWEVER, that said, there were other things that, in our opinion, were not acceptable.<br/><br/>Our first morning at the house, we found small dead bugs in the non dairy creamer. We brought it to their attention, in person. Obviously they were unaware of this and were very apologetic. We assumed this was just a fluke and things like this can happen. No worries.<br/><br/>Upon getting settled in, however, these are some of the big issues we had: <br/><br/>The master bed was a mattress and box spring that sat directly on the floor with no bed frame. The noise the bed made when you sat on it or moved around on it was unbearably loud and made sleeping extremely difficult. For 9 weeks!<br/><br/>The kitchen had major problems: We had FOUR spoons, ONE pan with the bottom scraped off (we do not have a picture because mid stay the handle broke off so we threw it away and bought a new one), no mixing bowls (we made and served salads in a cooking pot), one metal strainer that had RUST on it. A few mixmatched glasses, a few mixmatched bowls (the dishes were a full set) and a couple of disposable storage containers, one of which was an empty DOG TREAT container. A few pots, 2 with loose handles. There were many other kitchen items missing. When we mentioned this to the owners and asked for kitchen towels and oven mitts, they brought them over but said it was not their responsibility to provide us with everything. Based on the conversations we've had with others, actually, it is. We should have what we need to run a household day to day, especially for a 9 week stay. And everything should be in working condition and sanitary. Well, I guess we were on our own. We bought some pans, strainer, cutting board, and many other kitchen items we needed. Some were items she did supply but we were not comfortable using hers in the condition they were in.<br/><br/>The bottom of the bathtub was completely rubbed off and looked old and unsanitary.<br/><br/>Obviously, we were unhappy with our accommodations. It was clear to us as guests that our comfort and convenience were not not a priority. We wanted to shorten our stay but were unable to.

We dropped something under the bed and when we lifted the corner of the mattress to get between the slats of the frame it was horribly gross under there and looked like it hadn't ever been cleaned.

EXPIRED RENTAL LICENSE The Operating License (by code must be visible and up to date) for a rental had been expired since OCT2016 (over a year from our visit). HEALTH RISKS This rental would not pass any standard of healthcare inspection. Once we settled in my friend began to develop (what we now know to be) a severe lymphatic infection with inflammation in his respiratory system. His condition became worse and became a fever. We had to cancel plans for the Holiday and was unable to see his family as planned since he was bedridden. The illness persisted after leaving the rental but once we got home he required medical treatment and days off work for both him and I. Medical Professionals were confident it was from recent exposure to airborne toxins including dust and several types of mold. The air quality poor, including broken flooring and ceiling, all types of visible mold on the ceiling and in the crevices of the kitchen and bathroom tile. The dust was easily seen as large dust balls and debris underneath each of the beds. There were long hairs in multiple areas (upon arrival; see picture); and the bed sheets had hair, appeared used and insufficiently washed. SAFETY There was a Yellow Jacket nest very close to face height, near the sitting area in the back yard. This poses a significant risk if you have a severe allergy (as one of us does). The first aid box there did not include anything useful to prevent anaphylaxis shock. RISK OF DOG ATTACK BY NEIGHBOR PITBULL The backyard was fenced but the next door neighbor (in close proximity) owned a Pitbull that would not settle down. He was displaying territorial behavior and the owner had a cigarette and walked inside, clearly unperturbed. Unfortunately, this prevented us from letting the dogs outside without fervent supervision to ensure the safety of my dogs. I had to stand with my back to the Pitbull to attempt and block his view of my dogs . I even I tried to use tiki torches to create a barrier if the case he were to jump over the fence (well within his ability to do so). NOISE We were woken at early hours by incessant dog barking from the dog next-door. There were several other dogs in the neighborhood area that barked intermittently. PRIVACY There was no privacy inside the home; if the window had blinds they were broken. I had to stand up magazines along the window sill to cover the exposed areas and the ‘free wireless’ sign propped in the window facing out ensures the neighbors know your connection is not at all secure. I did not feel comfortable leaving any belongings of worth in the home while we left for the day. The keyless entry for the front door is convenient but did not have any latch lock or other...",2017-11,-0.966,2821,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The place itself was old, rundown, and unkept. Lots of damage all around the house. I found that at first glance it looked somewhat clean, but it was not. I understand an older house will not look as clean as a new house, but this was just plain dirty. The bottoms of my feet were dark with dirt after walking around for a few minutes. I saw a large puddle on the kitchen counter and wiped it with a paper towel and the paper towel was almost brown with grime. There were dust bunnies everywhere not the nice kind, even a few clumps of hair. If a bed is more than 3 inches off the ground, 6-7 in this case, the floor underneath should be clean. I don’t think under the bed had been cleaned in months. I found some questionable things on the floor I honestly couldn’t even examine. There’s a few seats in the living room, no couch. And a tiny tv, about 12-18 inches? Looks like a computer monitor. No cable, just antenna and a DVD player that works I think? But the remote for the tv didn’t work so we couldn’t switch input to it and try. Not a big deal as there was ONE dvd present. Outside was a nice yard however very unkept and dirty. Sweeping the concrete patio would have been a nice touch but it hadn’t been swept in months. Also dog poo out in the yard.

The morning of the last day I submitted a request to extend again around 6/7am. I got no response at all however, and when I went outside around 10 to pick up my Uber eats there was a man sitting in a truck in the parking lot who immediately began to gripe at me about how many guests I had over the course of my stay even tho he himself admitted that it never exceeded the allowed limit. He then followed it up by saying that I needed to hurry up and get out which confused me because I had extended and I knew it was available. He told me that the owner had told him that no I had to leave. I checked my app but I still hadn’t received any reply. Then at <10 min before check out I finally got a notification that me request to extend was being denied. The man from the parking lot then began knocking on the door every 5 or 10 minutes telling me to get out when I had ZERO time to pack my things up or prepare to check out. This resulted in a panic striken frenzy in which I tried to pack up all my things, clean up after myself, do everything on their checklist, and deal with this random dude banging on the door telling me to hurry faster. It was just mishandled in a really unfortunate way. I found out later that the same man had also bombarded two of my guests as they were leaving the night prior and started going on about the all the people I had over (two). So just know that your privacy isn’t exactly going to be respected here considering how intensely this dude had been watching and taking note of any comings or goings, round the clock, for my entire stay. 👎",2022-09,-0.0598,2120,16,-8.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

We had booked with him an approx. 3 week stay, to leave just before another booking for SXSW. Apparently, he booked our check-out on the same day as they were checking-in, which caused stress towards the end of our stay (below). In preparations, and probably to deal with some differed maintenance on the house, he had painters, general contractors, electricians, etc, come close to a dozen times during our stay, often without notice. <br/><br/>The house itself was really great, but furniture and finishes are not as shown. Blinds were cheap Home Depot paper that didn't retract without the use of plastic hair-type clips. Kitchen was poorly stocked. Mostly it seemed to be showing the wear of lots of booking and little re-furbishing as things were used or abused.  Maybe that has changed with all the work done during and perhaps after our stay. All this was easily looked over because it was a great modern house, until Michael became a dictator, and threatened to kick us out early if we didn't comply with his demands, no questions asked.  <br/><br/>He had, prior to booking, also scheduled a cleaner to come once per week, which turned out to be more of a method of checking up on us rather than cleaning. We had pre-approved 5 guests - two couples, and one single. We were accused of having more. We had pre-approved a small well-behaved well-traveled blue healer to stay with us. Towards the end of our stay, when Michael was needing more time to prepare the house for the next guest, he informed us that the dog was making too big of mess (you can read our prior reviews, of which almost all them had this same dog stay), and that we needed to leave a day early and pay an extra $150 cleaning fee.  This house has all hard wood or concrete floors, so a quick sweep and vacuum would clean up dog hair quickly.  Dog was not on the furniture.  I questioned the ""mess"" the dog was making, and he went into a tirade about how it was HIS HOUSE and we were going to do what he told us to, ""thanked"" me, and hung up on me. <br/><br/>I employ nearly 100 people, and work with 100s of clients and business partners annually, and his negotiation style is simply to demand. Perhaps Michael was under some stress, and he is normally a great guy, however, I wont stay with him again.  Its not worth the risk to stay with a host that threatens to kick its guests out because they wont accept his demands unquestioned.  We respected the house, we had the exact number and type of guests as booked, we received permission for the dog, we allowed him to continually invade our privacy with contractors and ""cleaners"", yet he made unreasonable demands and threats.

I defended that my party arrived to a dirty unit and had to do laundry on our vacation, but was still met with accusations.

Only after AirBNB got involved did Karen finally admit that she was in error and no cleaning service had been scheduled to clean after the previous guests.

The second that we realize that this was an issue we communicated with the host, and simply asked that we be reimbursed for the inconvenience of not being able to take a comfortable shower. The host then threatened to call the police on us and kick us out of the Airbnb, saying that “people like you are the reason why we are getting out of the Airbnb business“.  The house was poorly put together, although the pictures were representative of what the house had in it, the place looked like it had been put together from spare parts. Tiles from the floor were loose, curtains to the bathroom would fall off from the slightest touch, and everything just appeared to have been poorly thought out. Also The host told us that we had to keep the air conditioning above 73° at all times. When the host manual stated that the temperature should be simply kept at a reasonable temperature. It is a very hot summer and sleeping with the apartment at 73° or higher caused us to sweat. One morning we even woke up and the owner had change the thermostat from what we had set when sleeping, to 76° And so we woke up in a sweat. I do want to mention that they were only in the house to perform repairs on the hot water heater and did not enter it while we slept without permission. But changing the thermostat on us while we were sleeping without her permission was not acceptable. We travel a lot for work, and have stayed in A ton of Airbnb’s, and we have never had any issues with any host ever.

Ours had hair and what seemed like drool stains on our pillows, so we ended up washing them again after the first night. <br/>3) the Dishwasher had a weird smell and upon inspection, the liquid detergent never dissolved in the previous wash, which led us to believe unwashed dishes were put away before we arrived.

I did not stay here personally, but the groom party (including my three adult sons) stayed here along with their significant others. We had 12 Adults stay there. The fact that it was advertised to sleep 14 was, at best, a stretch. We had brought along 2 queen size airbeds in anticipation of this possibility, so there were enough beds. The guests ran into a few problems though. The beds were old and worn down and ""indented"" in the middle. The pillows were also old and worn down and some smelled of mildew. The bed sheets don't fit, and the converted garage did not cool down properly. It was much hotter in the ""garage"" than in the rest of the rooms. The decking outside needs to be refinished as well. The most immediate problem was that there was broken glass by the pool and some of the lighting was out and there was a terrible roach problem. We communicated these things to the host. She apologized and offered to let the guests use the hot tub for free. This was appreciated but did not solve the roach problem. We were here for my son's wedding so didn't have time to look for somewhere else to stay otherwise we would have looked elsewhere to stay. Once we got back home, we looked back at some reviews in Jue and found that the roach problem was a reoccurring problem.

The owner did not communicate this delay with me until after I had arrived. If they had it would have been less frustrating. <br/><br/>There are a few dogs in nearby yards that barked regularly, especially early in the morning. There's also some sort of train that you can hear blowing a whistle or something every few hours. <br/><br/>I had work I needed to complete early each morning, and the internet was quite slow. I did several speed tests and saw download speeds of 1 mbps and upload speed of .1 mbps, which was frustrating and did not seem reliable. <br/><br/>Despite the visit by the repairman, the shower was not fixed and the handle on the cold water was not working. So, after a bad night of sleep I didn't even get a good shower, but instead had to quickly rinse without scalding myself.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say the aesthetic and comfort of the unit is quite lacking, especially for the price-point.

There was quite a lot of his stuff around the place and I could see that indeed there was more cleaning to do. He also explained that he would be staying in the downstairs studio over night until he left town in the morning. I then left and ended up staying at my sister's house since I did not feel comfortable with Jean-Paul still at the place.

This would have sufficed, had the heater been safe to use. When I went to plug it in, I noticed it had burn marks on the plug. Luckily it wasn't too cold the first night so I went without heat. The next day however, was only in the 40s. I took the heater to the fire department for inspection, and they said it was not safe for use. They also could not guarantee safety with a new space heater because they could not determine what electrical outlet caused the burns. There was no way know if it was the wiring in the Airbnb or a different source. Given the 30 degree weather, this obviously made the Airstream uninhabitable. On top of that, the WiFi was not strong enough to hold a connection so watching any sort of TV was impossible.

Also there is no table or chairs on which to eat or to be able to work or write.  There are chairs and a table on a deck, but we're not sure how this would work if it rained.

Granted I paid in FULL for an event (Baby-Shower) to host, we had a check in time @ 2 pm. First thing I noticed was the trash bins filled to the top with trash. (Which the Host is trying to charge me for) When setting up we also noticed that someone else down the street was having an event as well, which we heard loud music from the backyard and the front of the house. Proceeded to enter into the property to set up for my event. Noticed a camera in the back yard but didn't pay it to much attention as I would also want to watch my property.  This issue started when I received a call from the host. 1hr after the event started at 5 pm. We had children playing in the pool ranging from 7-13. Having a blast, while the adults were at a table enjoying themselves with conversations. We had music playing at a REASONABLE volume for the respect of her neighbors.  I also walked towards the front of the property to ensure the music wasn't loud. (NOT A SOUND) However, the host called with a very RUDE and disrespectful attitude and told me the children were making to much noise. The CHILDREN playing in the pool??!! The noise ordinance did not start until 10:30 pm,(which is stated in her description) it was 5 pm. She then proceeded to call me and threaten me with the cops for the noise. I CALLED THE COPS MYSELF and had an officer come and check our noise to ensure we did not exceed. Officer stated he could not even hear the music from the front when he arrived. The officers that arrived when the host called never even stepped foot out of there patrol cars. If we had the music up SO HIGH why didn't APD ask us to lower it or even ticket us???  Had a few guesses out front saying goodbyes around 9:30-45  when they notice a very RUDE individual on the phone saying"" Yeah there are a lot of BLACKS here and they look like DRUG DEALERS"" He then went to the back to and speak with a group of elderly sitting at the table. Music was low enough for everyone to hear what he had to say as he was very rude and yelling. The farther to be intervened and ask him he needed to leave as ""WE"" paid for an event and paid to be here. The host stated only 6 guesses. NEVER was I made aware that I was only to have 6 guesses ?? Why would I have 6 guesses when I'm throwing an event?? By this time my phone was dead and did not bring a charged to charge.  She also mentioned our event lasted until 4 am. THIS IS A FLAT OUT LIE!! Only to try to get more money from me. My guesses included children and elderly, staying until 4 am?? NO, I DO NOT THINK SO!! She noticed that this was an Afro-American event and straight up judge us!! Having her ""Friend"" from 3 blocks away come and try to end my event is uncalled for. Him calling my friends and family "" BLACKS & DRUG DEALS"" uncalled for. We were ALL respectful! Just because my phone died she assumed I was ignoring her. She also stated we left trash all over her property, which is yet another lie. I have pictures to prove we left her property the same. We paid for a cleaning fee, however, we did ALL the cleaning.

There is a dog there that barked at us upon arrival and at other random times during our stay. We did not know there would be someone so close in the back house until after we booked it. There was no key hand-off like advertised, the front door was unlocked and the keys were sitting on the table. It was a nice, cozy cottage but pretty old; not worth $250 a night in my opinion. As we were walking through the house, we saw a huge waterbug (roach) in the back room which was very off putting. We saw several smaller bugs in other rooms also. There were 5 of us and one of the main reasons we booked this house was because it advertised 2 showers. We were disappointed to find out that the back shower's water pressure was so low we couldn't even use it. I tried and my shower literally took an hour. Both showers had pink mildew on them. That back bathroom did not have a door on it, just a curtain. The front bathroom's door did not close all the way. Not very private. We were asked to move our car and park in the dirt to the right of the driveway so that a car could access the back of the driveway for the back house. Several inconveniences. We got a noise complaint when we got back from 6th street from the owner of the house (who was staying literally just feet away in the back house). We quieted down right away. A few days after our stay, I get an e-mail about damaged property. A stool with water damage, trash pile too big in kitchen (the house rules specifically said we didn't have to take the trash out and that it was ok leave it all in one area), stains on the couch (which literally just looked like wet spots in the pictures he posted), and a ""ruined"" plant (it just looked like the plant had naturally wilted and dropped a few petals) on a side table that had water spilled on it. He wanted us to pay $100 for this which we all agreed was just ridiculous. We cleaned that place up before we left. We pretty much did the cleaning person's job for them when we really didn't have to. So the owner and I go back and forth about the damages. He realizes how crazy $100 for these minor ""damages"" is after I explain to him that nothing is really in need of repair except the stool. He lowers it to $80. Then to $65. The picture he posted of the replacement stool from Ikea costs $40.

Lets start with at first he was ok, responded with in 24/48 hours of my messages and even let us adjust our dates due to our flights being canceled.. SO fast forward to the day before out check in.. I flew in from California and had to spend the night int he air port and would arrive in Austin at 7am.. I had messaged Jonathan 10:30 PM Texas time and had said i was arriving early, and if early check in (around 1/2) but if not  could i at least drop off my bags so i didn't have to carry them around all day, but i didnt hear from him which is fine because it was late so i was excepting a reply in the am...In the morning i check and there was NO reply, around noon i emailed again asking what i needed to do further to get checked in... lock box, key pad, ect. Again no response.. by this time it is now 2pm so i had call him.. left a message hoping he would get it before 3pm due to that being our check in time, and again no response back.. at this point im exhausted and getting worried because there has been no communication from him.  We arrive at 3pm to check in, due to it being an apartment complex we had no idea which unit we were in, we called and messaged AGAIN! But once again no response.. i had taken a look around the place and saw a girl out side, i thought it was worth a shot to ask her if she knew Jonathan, and she did! I was so relived, so hes a  real person but just not responding. I told her we are supposed to stay in his place this weekend but cant get a hold of him, she says typical hes kind of flaky, but she gives his friends number to us. Apparently they both rent out their apartments and then stay in each others apartments when someone is renting it... seem strange to me but anyway we called this gal, i cant remember her name... And of course no answer.. By this time it is 4pm an hour after our check in and i call AIR BNB customer service, they we extremely helpful....So they tired contacting him ( in the mean time we still had our luggage and were just walking around the town with it). AT 6pm i received a call from air bnb and they said they couldn't get into contact with him either! they asked if i wanted to wait and see if he responded and i said NO! it seem so sketchy and unsafe to be staying with someone that isn't even responding to airbnb !! So we had to find a new place to stay, lucky air bnb had helped us with this... Later that night around 7:45pm i get a call from Jonathan.. I answer ""hello who is this?"" J-'this is your airbnb host, did you want to check in? sorry feel asleep""  ARE YOU KIDDING ME SO FOR ALMOST 24 HOURS YOUR WERE ASLEEP WHEN YOU KNEW YOU HAD PEOPLE ARRIVING! EVEN AIRBNB COULDN'T REACH HIM! And honestly  he didn't actually sound sorry at all as he giggled after he said he feel asleep, i responded with a ""nope"" and hung up the phone.

It’s hard to discern where the house is at night. The emailed instructions were inaccurate: the “long front driveway” has a big closed front wood gate facing the street. Ingrid asked us to unload/meet her in the back alley which is ANYTHING but convenient: narrow, uneven dirt drive, a dead end, and pitch black. You have to back out of the narrow lane flanked by neighbors’ cars. My driver declined Ingrid’s insistence to unload there (so dark she had to meet us with a flashlight); we used the gated gravel path in front instead. The house backs onto woods and the back gate has no lock. It’s pitch black. After attempting to sleep, I checked the windows and found all 6 downstairs windows unlocked.

No value gained from staying here and we will never return to this place or recommend it to anyone.  We feel the host was scamming us for more money.

Unfortunately, a few things went wrong during my 44 night stay. Please do not stay here.  Example, the host has surveillance everywhere and she has no tolerance for food deliveries left at the wrong door. You will receive a message from her every time your food order is dropped off incorrectly at her house, even when she is not home while you stay there. She will also go out of her way to charge you outside of airbnb for anything that goes wrong that may represent a monetary expense for her. Airbnb has a system set up for extra charges when something goes wrong. She will not use it. I felt very unsafe, paranoid, and overall uncomfortable. The house is great, good location, but in this price range, $4,500 mo, I would expect full amenities, no baby roaches on my toothbrush, and a more professional experience.",2020-11,-0.9311,961,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

Her cleaners had called her and told her they ""couldn't find any towels"" and she had ""seen them all a month ago."" Obviously, they must all have been stolen by us — two clients on a road trip who paid her $3,000.00 and got our kicks dabbling in the underground soiled towel market. <br/><br/>Before we knew it, she had turned around and billed us for all her towels, saying that ""AirBnb could help if needed.""

The couch was pretty beat up, the WiFi was unreliable, there was very little natural light, the towels and bathroom amenities were cheap, and the bed creaked so badly that any movement in the night would wake you up.

The blinds also provided no privacy in a busy neighborhood area as they were virtually see-through.

The place could have also been much better equipped considering it is for hosting larger groups. There were no cooking basics like oil, nothing to bake with such as baking sheets or dishes, and overall not many amenities or supplies were provided in comparison to other airbnbs I have stayed in. It felt like the owners were trying to cut costs anywhere they could which rubbed us the wrong way.

My main issue was the wifi, contacted the host shortly after arrival and he said he would be by “whenever he’s at the property next” to fix the issue. I responded asking for an ETA because I had some important meetings coming up and never heard back during my month stay. The only time I heard from him was at the end with him asking me to give him 5 stars in every category. Normally with a bad experience I don’t even write a review, but this just rubbed me the wrong way. If you look at the reviews of his other units on the property you can see that this is a known issue which hasn’t been fixed for months. The other issue was that the electricity in the living room would go out for 30mins-1 hour every couple of hours to the point I had to sleep on a friends couch for the last week of the trip because the AC would go out as well.

Unfortunately, due to the catastrophic Category 3 Hurricane Harvey that was forming in southeast Texas that same weekend, we regretted to cancel our trip to avoid any risks and impact of Harvey reaching the location of the airbnb, which would of course ruin a romantic weekend getaway, to say the least. <br/>We did much research on the hurricane and weather conditions in the area prior to cancelling the trip as we had both already taken off work and made other investments for the trip outside of our airbnb reservation. After much debate, we decided to formally cancel the trip about an hour after check-in since the developing hurricane's path looked to be close enough to pose an unsafe journey with nearby areas being evacuated, including my boyfriend's family who strongly advised not to venture anywhere near the Austin area that weekend. <br/>We thank Sean & Sarah for partially refunding the trip under their moderate cancellation policy. However, we were quite disappointed that due to such an unexpected and devastating natural disaster such as Hurricane Harvey, they were unwilling to make an exception and provide us a full refund. Based on our back and forth communication and their raving reviews, my impression is that Sean & Sarah are a very nice and decent family. However, in this case, there seemed to be a lack of compassion in their decision not to issue a full refund on account of the nearby Category 3 Hurricane Harvey. We do wish them well and hope they were not directly impacted by the devastation and regret that we couldn't keep our reservation we so looked forward to.",2017-08,-0.7096,1844,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

At check in we weren’t even able to access the property initially due to a second deadbolt being locked with a different key. I contacted the owner and she started frantically swearing. Not necessarily AT me but still very unprofessional to say the least. After a hidden key was located we were able to access the house. <br/><br/>Upon entering and looking around the property, we found it to be very much in disarray. Dishes left all over the counter, sticky substance on kitchen counter, messy dog bowls with food all over the floor in the dining room, the trash was not taken out from previous renter or owner, bathroom had toothpaste all over counter and their personal toothbrushes still there. A cabinet in the kitchen had both over the counter and prescription drugs within a child’s reach. This made me extremely uncomfortable as I have two children that I didn’t think should have access to that if they go to the kitchen for a drink. The refrigerator had the owners food and leftovers inside. I’m sure I’m leaving more out, but that will give you an idea. <br/><br/>When we contacted the owner regarding the condition of the property she stated that she had to leave in a rush because of an emergency with her dog, but that the house was still clean. She sent us pictures of what she said was just before she left the house, but they were clearly from another time because they did NOT match the current conditions. <br/><br/>We did not ask for a refund or even a discount on the nightly rate. We merely asked for the cleaning fee to be refunded since the property wasn’t left clean for us. The owner said no and was honestly extremely rude about it. She said because we had already received a 10% discount for booking as “non-refundable” (but that has nothing to do with the cleaning fee or cleanliness) she would only refund 40 dollars, period. Luckily AirBNB took care of the cleaning fee for us once we sent them the photos we took of the property.

I think this is a prime location to stay at to have access to a bunch of different areas. Check-in was easy.<br/><br/>My main problem was the house cleanliness. This is a full time home which I didn’t believe I read when originally booking the non-refundable stay. I may have missed it but I don’t believe this information was included. When we arrived there were crumbs and some sticky spots on the counters. When I communicated this I was told it was from the cleaning solution which is just not true. There were snacks left out and the floors had crumbs and dust and did not appear at the minimum vacuumed. The bathroom had children’s toys in the tub and overall there were just a very large amount of personal items left out. Again, for a lived in home this makes sense, but this was not the expectation I had from the pictures which do not show these items. I will credit that the cleaning fee was returned after some discussion.<br/><br/>My other problem is the bed situation.  This booking says 5 beds. One is the bed in the guest room which was fine. One is a twin bunk bed which cannot have adults which I didn’t initially know. One is the child’s bed which was depicted in pictures. But the second double bed is the trundle underneath the kids bed, which you do not have access too. It is really difficult to pull it out and use on the carpet. And the last bed is the “luxury air mattress” I was told. We only had 4 people and we were able to make this all work, but I think all of the “beds” need to be shown in the pictures and usable to count as beds listed on the booking.",2022-09,-0.1624,1668,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

She says there are 4 beds, really there are 2 beds, and she stuck 1 cot on the floor and 1 black leather couch that's extremely uncomfortable to sleep on (with no bedding provided) in the living room. Additionally, I'm shocked that she did not even offer essentials like SOAP, but offered 4 small hotel sample bottles of 'shampooing conditioner' that is clearly insufficient for 6 people. Additionally, her listing states that it's located in downtown Austin, but that's also not true (see map, it's in Clarksville).<br/><br/>Finally, I would not list below issues if the overall experience has not been completely subpar (beds and soap). The water pressure in the shower was so low that none of us have even washed our hair because the water pressure is so weak that we are afraid that shampoo couldn't get washed out.

The furniture seemed cheap and basic. The biggest issue was a snowstorm rolled through during our stay and knocked out the power. It was unprecedented for Austin and happened the day we checked out, so I don’t put this on the host at all. <br/><br/>However, in times like these I wished the host was a little more understanding and supportive. After we left, we had to leave our rental car in their parking spot as we got stuck in the snow with the roads being so bad. We scheduled to have the car picked up when weather permits. But this was the least of our problems. <br/><br/>We were stranded and there was no power in that part of town for almost a week. We spent the week hopping from hotel to the next searching for any food we could find. It was dire. I found it extremely insensitive for the host nag me about the car in the parking spot, saying they had guests staying there, which would have been impossible. The whole neighborhood had no power for almost 5 days. No one was coming in or out. How about checking with how someone is doing? The car eventually got picked up before a someone else ever checked in.<br/><br/>I think this speaks to a larger issue with Airbnb. Hosts are often very disconnected with what’s happening on the ground. They’re often not in town and they can’t help you when something really goes wrong. As for Airbnb itself, they don’t own any assets so they are limited in what they can do to help. That’s why there’s such a huge variance on their platform.

I walked out the room half naked as it was 1 in the morning. They gave me 15 minutes “to pack my shit and leave because I was in violation of Airbnb fire Marshall code for pets” officers words. I was not contacted by the host prior to having my privacy completely violated, and enduring emotional and physical stress that I had never experienced before over a puppy. <br/><br/>Here’s the factual story.<br/><br/> I wasn’t  impressed with the area/location of this air bnb but the inside has been remodeled/ upgraded by ikea to make up for the atrocious outer appearance and location (known drug area). <br/><br/>1. The inside of the home is as reflected in photos and the bed was comfortable for the one night. (You can tell the place is old as the floors creak when you walk.) <br/>2.

I had to sleep in my car from 1 in the am until 7 am when I drove 3 hours back to Houston and couldn’t work because of the emotional stress that was caused. The host did not try to contact me nor resolve this simple issue before it escalated and I was violated in a way I’ve never in my life experience.

Upon arrival, the first thing we noticed were the handful of prostitutes waiting not even 10 feet from the entrance, being picked up and dropped off by shady characters in shady vehicles right back at the same spot in front of the property (this was around 3pm mind you, but apparently they work right outside the complex at all hours of the day from our observation) The tenants in the building also pickup the prostitutes from outside the building and bring them into the property. Due to this unsafe activity I’m very suspicious of these “highly rated” reviews and it makes me question a lot about this host and property. We also discovered not only that this was NOT an isolated condo (as the photos and description of the property led us to believe) but an apartment on the second story of an apartment complex unit. It looks like it’s the projects. The property itself was run down and there was a constant smell of cigerette smoke permeating the air around our unit. Soon as we walked up to our door we noticed hornets crawling into the top casting around the door. We quickly entered into our unit and found that the inside indeed did not match the exterior of this property, so we applaud the host for attempting to ugrade the quality of their unit somewhat. Like putting lipstick on a pig as a previous review mentioned... We found things to be relatively clean the first hour or so, until we began to comb through the bedsheets and towels and found an assortment of stains, noticing that the white sheets and towels had a rather unsettling off white color, not to mention how starchy and stiff the towels were as if they'd sustained every type of mess possible. We shrugged these things off, even the prostitutes outside initially, as well as the strange men around the complex who would sit in their vehicles for hours sometimes at night. We tried to overlook the complete dishonest description and just enjoy our stay but not even within several hours of our check in we began to find ROACHES in every single room in this place. We stood from the 4th until the 9th of september and EACH DAY here we found more and more roaches, in the bedroom, in the living room on the wall behind our heads as we watched tv, in the refrigerator and microwave ?!!!! Now we are no stranger to unruly environments, we are familiar with the hood and the circumstances of the ghetto but we did NOT pay to go stay in one during our birthday vacation. Disgusting and terribly dishonest on the host's part to not disclose neither the dynamics of the area. Bugs are a normal part of Texas living and hot weather, but this many ROACHES in a house is not healthy nor is it safe or comfortable. We tried our best to tough out the stay, it was unfortunately too last minute and expensive to stay in another airbnb in the area or at a hotel for the remainder of our stay but because of the non stop bugs we kept ourselves outside and about most of the day to avoid them. The roaches inside the fridge were absolutely disgusting and prevented us from keeping any leftovers or food inside the fridge during our stay, which was not only annoying but also expensive. This place is not safe for women alone, I would have not completed my stay if my boyfriend wasn’t with me. You may wonder why I did not communicate anything to the host right?! Just read his lack of accountability or lack empathy and aggressive responses on his previous reviews. I personally don’t like aggressive confrontation and I didn’t need anything or anyone else to ruin our vacation trip even more. I also normally don’t leave bad reviews so <br/>PLEASE DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS HOST IF YOU CAN HELP IT.",2021-09,-0.9859,3992,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

She quickly replied that it was!!<br/>In reality, the house is in a suburban residential neighborhood, and not within a walking distance of ANYTHING.<br/>When I communicated the deception to her, she replied ""YOU CAN RENT A CAR.""<br/><br/>2.

I arrived at Valdete's place in the afternoon, after a 20hrs transatlantic flight, with 3 suitcases. I had no car and no internet connection to book an alternative place therefore, therefore I HAD to stay the night. I checked out the next morning and left the room intact and spotless! <br/>AND WAS CHARGED $249 FOR THAT ONE NIGHT!!!  <br/>There is a saying that goes, ""Marry the person you will want to divorce.""

There were smears on windows, sugar rings from previous drinks, sticky residue in the fridge and freezer. The bathroom doors didn’t have knobs so there were just holes in the middle of the door where a handle and lock should be. The showers (both) were not clean and had hair scattered throughout. There were also someone’s dirty clothes found under one of the beds. In addition, the big windows in the living area had floor to ceiling blinds that didn’t work so our view was obstructed. <br/><br/>I’m certainly one that rarely complains or  writes a review.

Downside was that there were so many homeless people and crackheads walking around that we felt unsafe at times to walk towards 6th Street. Got harassed by someone asking us if we could buy them alcohol and then they got super aggressive when we said no. The condo itself would be very nice if owners would do upkeep/maintenance on it. One of the sinks in the bathroom is clogged and needs the drain to be cleaned out. The living room blind on the  right side won’t raise at all the chain is broke and not seated in the detent. The floors are so dirty that when we walked with white socks on around the condo it turned them completely black. There was a roach in one of the bedrooms the first night and we had to kill it. The bathroom lights in the guest bath flicker like a strobe light and hum super loud. The door handle to the condo is either busted or incorrectly installed. It will only open the door if you raise the handle up backwards. Led to us standing outside for 30 minutes in 100 degree heat trying to contact the owner about it. The metal coffee table in the living room was so wobbly we couldn’t even put drinks on it. Views from balcony were super nice.

I turned off the water and had to decide whether to try to come out or wait until the water subsided, but it wasn't going anywhere. I got a pot from the kitchen and began to empty out the water into the toilet.

I am wondering the same thing.<br/>I informed Ryan of the issue and he said his housekeeper was going to take care of it. <br/>At this point, however, it had become clear that this was not going to work because I had no more interest in going into the shower with obvious plumbing problems and we asked to leave one night early to stay in a hotel.<br/>After some back and forth with Ryan, he did apologize and offered some reimbursement, which we accepted.<br/>However, overall the place left me with quite an unpleasant feeling.

The house in general is conveniently close to downtown and South Congress area. We appreciated the location since we had so little time in Austin and wanted to make sure we were staying within the vicinity of places we wanted to visit west of the lake. However, our actual experience wasn't so great. We booked here for 2 nights for 4 people, which would have been perfect since there are two bedrooms. Upon arrival at the unit, everything for the most part was fine, just minor things like not having enough towels. We were given 2 to use for 4 people. We contacted Ryan, and he let us know that we would get additional towels the following day. We were already exhausted from traveling, so we figured it was okay and would just make it work for the night. We rested at the apartment for about an hour before heading out to dinner. When we came home for the night, we couldn’t rest like we had hoped. While settling in, we discovered tiny bugs crawling all over the dresser tops. This prompted us to check the rest of the house, and noticed the bugs were also crawling along both bedposts, the mattresses, and on the floor. We were unsure what types of bugs they were but were uncomfortable sleeping under those conditions. Some of us also noticed bug bites on our bodies, so we contacted Ryan right away to let him know about our discomfort and to see how we could resolve it. At this point it was already 11:30 PM, and since we couldn’t get a response from him we decided it was best to leave the unit for the night. We didn’t stay there for the rest of the weekend because we were unsure whether it was an infestation. Ryan did not return our message until almost a day later (21 hours), and instead of working with us on a solution, his response was unsympathetic, hostile, and accusatory. He basically started by claiming he gave us enough towels, even though in his previous note he apologized for not giving us enough, then said that his housekeeper cleans the unit every time and that there were absolutely no bugs whatsoever (even though we had pictures and a video to prove they were there). He also immediately referred to us as guests who made him not want to host Airbnb. I was so confused by the tone and I’m extremely disappointed by this experience overall.

If we could see into their house, they could likely see into the unit.  Therefore, we kept the shade down because it didn't feel private.  If the motorized garage door-like shade is down, it blocks your view of outside and your entrance/exit to the unit.  It  made me feel uneasy and uncomfortable in there.  Also, told the host I accidentally broke a wine glass while doing dishes, left $5 to cover the cost but did not hear back.  Communication was... eh.

I have never experienced an Airbnb host who has acted like a warden of a prison but thats how we felt. To cap it off after checking out Paddy sent a final climatic SMS which accused us of stealing bed sheets and a 2nd set of keys which were never there & threatened to charge us a surcharge for not separating our recycling again + a $40 fee for some dog droppings we missed under a plant in the yard.

A few of my colleagues and I were town for a busy professional conference and needed accommodations close to the convention center. This AirBnB was in a prime location (the only plus), but on arrival it was clear that the unit was incompletely cleaned and DIRTY. There was hair on the bathroom floor and in the drain, and visible dust everywhere. After communicating my concerns to the host, he supposedly sent a cleaning service over to the unit to address issues, but I cannot confirm this because I was not in the unit at the time and when I returned the same hair and dust were strewn about. After reaching out another time, providing pictures, and requesting a partial refund, he did not respond so I escalated my complaints to AirBnB. Absolutely terrible.

If you long for your fraternity days walking into a trashed house after a massive party to find the place wrecked maybe it would be for you.

I really don't know how anyone sleep there, the bed was filthy and the linens obviously haven't been washed in months. Don't get me started on the bathroom either, but apparently Will and his roommates don't believe in toilet paper.

I booked this rental in early March for a very special occasion in late July. My family flew in from all over the country to stay here, and it was a disaster to say the least.

Additionally, the cleaning crew missed many areas in the house, including black mold in the downstairs bathroom, undergarments and hair left in rooms and bathroom drawers, and a layer of filth on the playground equipment that made them unusable. There is also no play set outside. It’s been replaced by a trampoline that’s full of leaves and mud. The owner has a side business that she runs out of a small house behind the rental property, so be prepared for her workers to open the front gate and walk through the part of the yard that’s advertised in the renal photos to get back there. We were given no prior warning that they would come through the rental property, and one worker in particular got very hostile and refused to tell me why he was walking through the yard even after I explained  that I rented the Airbnb for the weekend.

But we didn't even get that. Let me tell you what we paid for: a clean private bedroom for me, my friend and our 2 dogs to sleep in. (With an increased cleaning fee which was agreed upon between Melvin and me) which I was totally fine with and happy that he was open to negotiation as he normally doesn't house dogs, which was nice of him to accommodate. So let me tell you what we actually got for our money: a place for our dogs to sleep. Let me tell you what we didn't get: A clean place to stay. It was a pig sty. There were cardboard boxes littered throughout, open and unopened. The kitchen had a stacked sink and dirty dishes scattered across The countertops and was completely unpresentable. And not to mention when we walked in we were hit with an overpowering stench of weed (to which our host said part of his cleaning was to keep the window open and now we know why...fresh air couldn't rid the place of that stench of weed) To his defense, the bedroom we were supposed to stay in was neat and tidy. When we first arrived we knocked several times before he answered. When he opened the door we weren't sure we were in the right place as he didn't invite us in or welcome us. Not a friendly greeting. I understand people being introverted and this by no means is an attack on his personality but, coming from someone who has hosted people frequently via air bnb, part of your being a host is to be just that (definition of host: a person who receives or entertains other people as guests) we did not feel received, entertained or welcomed as guests. It was just uncomfortable. So remember, we paid to sleep at a place, so tell me why we ended up sleeping in my truck? Our host had locked us out via the deadbolt so we couldn't get in. We tried for hours in the middle of the night to call, text and bang on the door to get his attention. And by banged I mean BANGED. I would say I'm surprised he couldn't hear us but the stench of weed lends itself to providing an explanation for his lack of appearance. So with no assistance by our host, we 'slept' in our truck in the parking lot of the complex. I'm only thankful we Drive a truck as this could have been even worse. Worrying about our animals that we couldn't get to preoccupied most of our thoughts. Approximately 2 hours later my friend decided to try his phone again. We are now at 7am.

Wet towels in the washer, unwatered house plants and lots of old books, movies and stuff. <br/><br/>Most of the house was reasonably clean, but the floors were filthy.

You do not have a key to the house yet only one of the two code locks will open via code and neither will lock via the code pad.<br/>- I saw another review mention the not-curtained upstairs windows but that is actually the only room with any curtains at all. There are absolutely none downstairs, including in the two bedrooms which have large windows. There is nothing separating you and the neighbor’s windows, giving no privacy or save from the morning sun. In the middle bedroom your room is visible from the house’s hallway too.<br/>- Old windows let in a draft, large cracks.<br/>- The hot water mostly does not reach upstairs, so it’s impossible to use the nice big bathroom for a hot shower.<br/>- The downstairs bathroom has a sliding door that is very separated from the wall giving no soundproofing from the kitchen sitting area or bedroom near it. The door has no handle on the inside and isn’t on a full track so you can’t open it by pushing against it, so you have to smash your hand between the door and wall to grab the end and pull it open. The cubicle shower has no shower curtain or door and no mat was provided, so you have to shower against the wall to not completely flood the bathroom floor.<br/>- The WiFi does not reach past the kitchen/one half of the house. So no WiFi in the living room or bigger bedroom.<br/>- The bedroom near the side entrance has two lamps, yet one is not even plugged in because they didn’t bother putting an extension cord.<br/>- The tv has a DVD player yet no cords connecting it. Also with no WiFi or internet connectivity, don’t expect to use any streaming services.<br/>- Middle hallway has round rocks that are painful to walk on and very difficult for older people.

At first the Airbnb seemed great, but after dropping off our stuff and leaving for the day, we came back at night to a HOT tiny home. It felt like entering your car after you leave it in the sun for a while. We had a lot of trouble sleeping considering the bed was up top and heat rises and were even sweating throughout the night without a blanket! We cranked the A/C to its maximum but by morning it still wasn’t working. On top of that there was this light outside the window right next to the bed that was so bright, so if you are the type that has trouble sleeping with a light on or with what seems like shades being open, don’t go here.

This is where things went from bad to worse.

It was 6 of us total, so the appeal of the number of beds is why we chose this house.<br/><br/>It honestly isn't equipped to have this many people stay at the house. It does sleep 8, but when we checked in there's only a small kitchen table and only 3 chairs available, one was apparently broken with no additional chairs. We had to go to my son's apartment and use a few of his fold out chairs, if we were guests without someone like him in town we would have had to go buy our own as the host wasn't available until after dinner with no communication up front that this would be the case. There's only 1 couch to sit on, so entertaining within the house is difficult. Only 1 lounge chair outside, so don't expect to readily enjoy the back yard, however it does have potential.<br/><br/>We did address this to Ben, he came on our second day and tried to smooth things over, but it honestly felt like he wasn't taking ownership of the lack of amenities. It was either previous guests stealing or breaking things, or that there were folding chairs but were left out in the rain last week and broke (it hadn't rained in weeks, we checked), but overall just left a bad taste in our mouth that he didn't really care.

To have it become a bed you have to put together a thin foam pad and lay it on top. This was a hassle and once completed still extremely uncomfortable.

The pull down bed was awful and uncomfortable, I woke up 10 or more times each night. The location was pretty good not too far from the tourist activities and restaurants.

We were in town for a wedding and stayed to see Austin.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/>•	Great communication about property<br/>•	Quick response times<br/>•	Well-stocked kitchen<br/>•	Great location, close to SoCo and it's a lovely, quiet neighborhood <br/><br/>The hosts were wonderfully communicative about who was on the property and when. That was so appreciated! As we were in an unfamiliar city, this was a huge comfort to us. They were also quick to respond to any questions. <br/><br/>About the property, the day we arrived I was praying for coffee and was so happy there was some. It doesn’t seem like much but when you’ve been traveling it’s the little things that get you through! The same with the kitchen – I was so glad there was a basic spice set, oil, and utensils. It enabled us to cook what we could at the ABNB instead of eating out every night. It's also very close to SoCo (walking distance) which was really nice!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>NEUTRAL / THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THE PROPERTY FOR FUTURE GUESTS:<br/>•	Slow internet (We know this isn’t the host's fault but we’d like to note it for future guests who may need to work remote)<br/>•	Laundry is not in unit, it’s coin-operated, and it only takes quarters<br/><br/>My partner had to work several days while we were in Austin and the internet was unreliable. During work meetings, he’d get disconnected often (this also happened when we were watching Netflix and playing video games – but that’s more annoying than problematic).<br/><br/>Another thing to note: The laundry is in the next building over and you need to bring your own quarters. We also had to have a Lyft driver stop at a gas station so we could get quarters because we were travelling and didn’t have any change! :O <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>•	Lots of rules, not a relaxed vibe<br/>•	You get two rolls of toilet paper and then have to purchase your own <br/><br/>Our personal feelings were that there were so many rules and notes, we ultimately felt unwelcome. We tried to read through everything but I kept rereading them to make sure we weren’t doing anything wrong or accidentally incurring fines. <br/><br/>My biggest annoyance was that hosts did not provide enough toilet paper for our stay. I think this is really odd. I had to take a Lyft to a gas station to get more. We paid $160 a night to stay here. How much is a pack of 24 toilet paper, $11? I messaged the hosts and they responded that they only provide a ""starter kit"" of TP. I was unhappy with this response but it felt so bizarre having to ""argue"" for more. On all of their info it says “Let us know what we can do to make your stay comfortable”...but then I had to argue to get more TP? After sending my note, the hosts did send more but the whole thing felt so strange to me. We used an additional *one* roll.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/><br/>In the check-out instructions it said “will not accommodate last check-outs”. Totally fine! As we were leaving, I really needed to use the restroom. I thought to myself, “with all these rules, if I use the bathroom and we leave 15 minutes after our check-out time, are they going to charge me for a late checkout?” Especially after the toilet paper thing, I just wasn't sure, so I had to wait until we got to the airport to use the restroom.

This worked for our group- two families with 2 and 3 kids, and the grandparents. The house was fairly clean, not perfect, but nothing too bad. At first glance it was perfect, but after more inspection, it was just so-so. The major issue was the beds. They were SOOO soft that no one slept well. My husband and I could not sleep in the same bed without rolling to the middle, basically on top of each other. The second issue was the internet, which was sporadic. The AC went off a few times because the nest thermostat needed internet. That was awful and we woke up sweating and grouchy one morning. We also tried to watch a movie but couldn't because the internet wasn't working. We emailed GuestSpaces and then called the next day. They did call back a few hours later and helped us get the issue fixed, but that was a day before we were checking out (of a 6 day stay).<br/>The other issue was a minor one.

So the pictures definitely are misleading at the first place. The room is a garage room which wasn't mentioned. So no windows which is very depressing. The room itself is fine but because it's built inside the garage, obviously the outside is all a mess and untidy. There is one bathroom shared between 4 rooms, which again is kind of ok. The sink would not drain out the water and it took time to do that. No bath mat outside the shower, which makes the floor too slippery after a shower and can lead to a possible accident. The bathroom definitely needs repair and a makeover. There is a wierd wet smell inside the property, which is not too pleasant.  The property and common areas need repair,  maintainence and upgrades.

And great location, a very short uber ride away from downtown. Unfortunately, we had many negative experiences with this house so we would not stay here again unless the host fixes these things. The biggest issue was that the keypads to the doors were both smashed (looked like a broken iphone) and therefore, were not easy to use. When leaving the house, we were unable to lock the doors. It felt unsafe. Eventually we were able to leave through the backyard, but it was very inconvenient. The pool was only usable on day 1 as the pool turned very green with algae the next day. Hanging out in the kitchen or in the living room at night was made difficult by the intrusion of cockroaches. We saw over 10 cockroaches during our short stay. Lastly, the host was not good at communicating. In the months leading up to the trip, the host would not answer my messages or questions so I had to call AirBnb to reach out to him. Then during our stay, he rarely responded to my messages and never called back when I left a voicemail on his phone asking about the broken keypads.

DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE, or do so at your own risk of not having somewhere to stay when you get there!! <br/><br/>When we arrived to the house on 6/2/22, there was a CEASE AND DESIST letter from the City of Austin stuck to the front door, dated in permanent marker 6/1/22.  It stated that the owner was running an illegal rental operation, and no one was allowed to enter the property until the owner met with the City, or they would be subject to fines something like $2k per night. The letter wasn't exactly clear if just the host/owner would be fined, or anyone they found on the property.  We called Airbnb, who called the host, numerous times. No answer. FOR HOURS. It was 100 degrees outside and getting late in the evening, so we waited inside the airbnb while we frantically tried to find a new airbnb that would accommodate our group of 10 on the same day. Airbnb helped us secure a new location, even though the process took 5 HOURS on the phone with Airbnb from when we arrived to when we had a solution, so we wasted a whole night dealing with this issue. The host finally responded to us on Airbnb messenger a few hours after we arrived and just wrote back ""Oh no worries, the city's files aren't updated :) "" Um, really? We never heard anything else from them again, nor did they ever check in to see what we wanted to do.  <br/><br/>Besides the complete lack of concern on the host's part, when we did a walk through of the property, it's clear the house receives little-to-no attention from the host. The pool was green-ish, there was a dead cockroach in the living room, stains on the walls, ceilings, linens. Opened food in the pantry and freezer. We have pictures of everything to back up this post.  We ended up at the Governor's Mansion that's 12 minutes away from this one, and we're so thankful the Governor's Mansion saved our trip.

Tuesday and Thursday morning, sometimes before 7, are trash days, and the dumpsters are less than twenty yards from the bedroom window.

Later while I was watching TV, Phil scurried across the floor and died by the door. Roaches are to be expected in older apartments—and clearly they do use pesticide...RIP Phil—so I didn’t mind that much. That said, the pictures make the place look much, much newer than it is, which is a pet peeve of mine. <br/><br/>The disposal was not working upon arrival, though I did get it going later.

Overall, we are deeply saddened about our experience. I think it’s important to provide an accurate and honest review, so that other guests do not have the same experience. Please read the full review. <br/><br/>** TLDR:  <br/>Cons: Terrible communication, dirty, inefficient AC, cockroaches, and RATS!!<br/>Pros: Dog friendly, convenient location**<br/><br/>The pros of this apartment is that the location is convenient if you need to get downtown and close to stores, you have access to laundry (that you will need to pay a few bucks for), and that it is dog friendly. This is where all the pros end. <br/><br/>Firstly, when we checked in we noticed that the unit is run down and much older than the photographs/listing suggest. As other reviews mention, the unit could use a renovation due to chipped kitchen surfaces, rusty kitchen sink, damaged bathroom, stained bathroom tiles, damaged paint, patched up dry wall. Not to mention, it’s darker and dingier than the photos suggest. <br/><br/>Additionally, we walked in to see the bathroom was still dirty from previous guests, initially thinking this was black mould, we alerted our host. Moreover, we had one fork between the two of us for a 12-day stay. Given this was in the first 24-48 hours, we found that the host at this point was responsive and willing to resolve this issue. They sent out a new cleaner the next day who recleaned the bathroom and we got some new silverware. <br/><br/>A few days later, we noticed our AC was not cooling as we liked, and was cooling inefficiently and to around 76-77 in the day. As we were working from home, and adjusting to the Texan heat, we found this was good enough. Unfortunately, you do not have full control over the Nest system, and can only set between parameters of their choosing. I let the host know, and they assured me they’d let maintenance know, however we never had anyone come out to resolve the AC, despite the host informing me someone came out to fix it. This was totally inaccurate as we were home ALL day, and no one came by. Again, I let the host know and nothing was resolved. They did not respond to me and we just managed with them AC as is.<br/><br/>At this point, I was sort of annoyed about the stay, but was going to get over it and call it a doozy and that be it. Until our final night where we were awoken at 2:00am by the loud sound of an animal stuck in a sticky trap in the kitchen/hallway. It was flapping around and banging. We contacted the host and there was NO response. We contacted air b n b and they too contacted the host. We noticed that the critter was a large rat. The sound the animal was making from pain as well as trying to escape was horrific, so horrific we could not sleep. Eventually the rat managed to escape which means the rat was running around the apartment with us and our belongings!!! We were totally disgusted & left early in the morning, completely exhausted - we camped out in a parking lot until we could leave, that’s how bad it was! Not to mention, I’ve been informed by authorities that sticky traps are ILLEGAL due to the sheer cruelty. <br/><br/>The only communication we received back from the host was 1) an automated message asking if we were going to be leaving early so they could clean (ha!!!!) 2) an apology for a slow response and that they’d alerted maintenance - NO apology about the rat. NO apology about the vile and UNSAFE experience we had. <br/><br/>It’s totally unacceptable, and we have sent messages to the management and it is now over 48 hours, and we have heard NOTHING in return. <br/><br/>We spent over $2000 - $200 plus of which was for a cleaning fee when honestly the place is so filthy (don’t look under sofas you’ll see huge dirty dust bunnies, hair, and cockroaches!) Save your money and find another property!!! <br/><br/>We stayed in Austin in April with another host and had an incredible time, while this was the antithesis of that experience!!!! We have only ever had positive air b n b experiences, so we were honestly just so surprised that this was so terrible. <br/><br/>If you’ve made it this far - I hope this informs your decision to NOT stay at this place and do NOT stay at any of their other properties, because if you unfortunately face any issues during your stay, you likely will not have them resolved.  <br/><br/>[They will probably claim we are after money, like they responded to some other poor individual that stayed here, but I have all the evidence to back up my review - which I have shared with air b n b, and the host.]",2022-08,-0.9942,4681,2,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

They're a huge company that has poor communication and no personal touch. After booking thru Airbnb we were contacted by turnkey and we're told that we had to sign a lease. Like a real, proper, multiple page lease that you'd sign to rent an apartment, not a weekend airbnb. We complained to Airbnb and they verified that we shouldn't  have to sign. Airbnb should take on the responsibility of being the middle man and streamline the whole process to reduce red tape. We told multiple people at TurnKey this, but they weren't  having it.  The day before  our family  trip we decided  to just copulate and gave up the fight.  But  then to make matters worse, to access the lease and information about the property  you have to go thru their online portal via another third party: IDology. They've got your birthday, home address and more. I mean they're allegedly a reputable company, but now your personal info is in yet another database for yet another company. AirBNB should be the middle man. That's the whole point of the service! We're still figuring this out with Airbnb, but be warned that if you want to book with turnkey you'll have to go thru their processes. <br/><br/>The house itself was adequate but it didn't seem as nice as in the pictures. There were scuffs on walls, dusty windows, and water from one of the showers never quite got hot. The blinds provide zero privacy during the night when lights  are on.

While Diana and Micah were responsive to our report of the issue, they unfortunately were unable to get the issue resolved during our stay. They offered a partial refund ($100 of the nearly $1500 it cost to stay) and a 20% discount if we came back in the future. When I asked that we receive the 20% discount now given how uncomfortably hot it was inside (over 80 degrees), I was rebuffed and offered 15%. Although they were quick to send this money, $180 off didn’t feel like a good value for how uncomfortably hot it was. It was also disappointing to find the lake almost completely dried up, significantly different than the photos of a dock floating on inviting water. And finally it must be acknowledged that one of the neighbors clearly dislikes AirBNB guests - the house rules and additional messages from Diana and Micah made it very clear that even accidentally turning in to the wrong driveway was a problem. (not tough to do considering how close the houses are). Not to mention the death stares my group got from this neighbor as we arrived.

Also, near the grilling area the railing is very loose. The drop is much further on this side. This could be a huge liability if someone falls and gets seriously injured. We had children with us so safety is a big thing for our family.<br/>-Very poorly stocked kitchen; not even the can opener functioned (it was rusted to the point of being fused). No pizza cutter, strainer for pasta, or adequately sized pots/pans. The two non stick skillets were completely scratched up making them unsafe to use. We weren't expecting a chef's kitchen, but with three kids, eating out every meal was not an option. Making dinner was extremely difficult not having basics available and we ended up having to go out and buy a cooking pan with a lid.<br/>-The property listing does not say that there would be any lake toys, however, it would make the property more appealing for future guests. We have stayed at other lake properties who have kayaks, paddle boards, plenty of lake toys available for our use that we don't own since we don't live on or near a lake. When we asked the homeowners about this, they stated that in the past their things have been stolen. I suggest a shed or storing them with a padlock on the dock like all the other houses in the cove.<br/>-White patio around the house was very dirty due to mud being churned up by sprinkler system at the back of the home.<br/>-Difficult to get to property and park; we were worried about the neighbors during our stay since it was highly emphasized not to go anywhere near their parking areas. It was obvious neighbors don't like having an Air BnB property nearby when they let their large scary dog wander into our yard.<br/>-Cameras outside home on patio were not disclosed in the listing as per Air BnB policy. The camera was functioning because we saw the green light on. This made us uncomfortable being that the camera was pointed at the back patio where we hung out most of the time.

We had no privacy and felt like we were in the way of the host and her family, which included many cigarette smokers 🤢.

Also, the bathroom door is broken and doesn’t close and the fridge ice-maker doesn’t work 🙄.

This house had not been properly cleaned.  The first thing we saw when we walked in was a sofa that had all of the cushions askew.  The floors in the hallways needed to be swept.  The bed in the back room had a comforter that was not on straight.  When we pulled it back, the sheets were all messed up as if they had been slept in and then the cover was just pulled over.  The back porch had trash that had not been thrown away.  The final straw was the vomit on the side of the toilet and the floor.  I understand that the maid service may have just had a bad day, but it was clearly not ready for guests.  I was also upset to see that several people before us had commented on the HVAC system being out.  The morning we arrived, I got an email saying that the system was out as if it had just happened.  After reading the other reviews, I believe that it had been out for some time.  Though not related to the cleanliness, I will also comment that this neighborhood did not feel safe.

There’s a king bed, queen bed, full size top and bottom bunk and lots of couches. The patio is a nice touch. The location is great in terms of being nearby downtown etc. They have a lot of board games available. <br/><br/>Cons: The house is next to a train track and the noisy train seems to run at night. A couple of my grown friends were spooked. The entire house is like that one drawer that’s filled with those odds and ends that you have no idea where to put them. The layout is odd and the furniture is awkwardly large. All the linens and towels were disheveled in the closet. The cleaning fee is as much as the stay, but they make you take off the bedsheets and towels and set it next to the washer before you leave. We had nearly zero amenities - no toothpaste, razors, etc that was listed on the site. There were not even paper towels or napkins in the kitchen. Many kitchen utensils were burned, dishes, cups, cutting boards were dirty in the cabinets, and the pots and pans were near impossible to reach even for a 6-foot-tall man. The smaller bathroom smelled of urine. The house manual has a gazillion rules and potential charges if you use extra towels/linens, have an accidental spill, or leave 30 min later than the checkout time. I was stressed on my vacation with making sure we didn’t break any of these rules. The yard appears neglected.

They do not provide any cream for your coffee and no snacks like most other Airbnb so if you like your coffee light like me, make sure you bring your own creamer.  The water here tasted particularly awful, maybe the worst tap water I’ve ever tasted.  They provide a Brita water filter but it does not help with the bad water taste much.

The house does not have central air and heating - window air units – this was not disclosed and is intentionally hidden in advertised photos. There are some structural issues (i.e. hole in the flood in bedroom). The home is not as it appeared on the advertisement. The description and photos are made to seem much nicer than the actual location. High reported crime area - not disclosed on listing. The value is not worth the price asked for on the listing. The listing is very different in person compared to the online description. We were two females and did not feel safe or comfortable staying in the house for the weekend.

When we arrived the trash was piled  up coming out of the trash bins and on the ground as if it had not been disposed of in weeks.<br/><br/> We were given an alarm code to use after being advised that the alarm was set.  Upon entering the home we found that the alarm was not set and it was still dirty in each and every room and bathroom from the previous guests.  There were towels all over the floors as well as the beds were still tossed and unmade with dirty linens from the previous guests. There were dishes in the sink, trash in the trash cans and also personal items still there from the previous occupants.  The sectional had a broken frame, stools were missing from the kitchen table, secondary bedroom door was off thr track. master bedroom door hinge was off with screws on the floor....luckily we did not have small children with us.  Also, a majority of the lights were out on the patio light strands.  We tried to reach Kade several times but he did not reply.   Someone (Alex) else finally replied and she tried to help and also advised that this was not her property.  She was eventually able to get someone there to clean the house.   There were also no wash cloths there and we did not get them until day 2 about 9pm or so.    I sent a message saying that we were being ignored and Kade eventually sent 2 messages about towels and I never heard from him again. <br/><br/> Kade never did follow up to see if things were good after all of the issues that we had the first two days.   Nor did he ever follow up during or after the trip with an apology. <br/><br/>This location does have a lot of road noise as it is by a overpass/highway, a train runs near a few times a day as well as quite a bit of airplane traffic. Therefore, if you are looking for a quiet stay this is not the place for you.<br/><br/>I did request a refund of part of my money when I returned home and Kade did advise that he would get the refund processed the same day that he replied.   After several days went by there was no refund.<br/> I did try to contact him again about the refund and again,  no reply.  I ended up having to contact the Resolution Center through Airbnb to communicate with Kade on my behalf.<br/><br/> The Resolution Center was very prompt and they did get my refund in a very timely manner.<br/><br/> This was the most horrible home rental that my family and I have ever experienced.  It put a bad taste in our mouth from the very beginning of the trip and it was hard to enjoy ourselves for the time there.  We were so glad to get back home! <br/><br/>We usually rent homes through VRBO and have had no issues.  I will try Airbnb again as I will not let this stay spoil it for this company.  The Airbnb staff that assisted me was great.<br/><br/>*** Something to note- if you experience a problem with your property when renting with airbnb please contact airbnb immediately (within 24 hours) as you could be do a full refund.

They communicate great when asking questions prior to booking (although they keep trying to redirect you off Airbnbs platform) but once you book they won't respond. <br/>*Beds are extremely lumpy, squeeky (barely move and you wake the other person up and overall gross.<br/>*Most TVs (main room greatroom for hanging out and Master bedroom) do not work/have cable and are not smart TVs. This means no ability to have family/hang out /unwind time together while someone cooks and others watch tv like planned. <br/>*Internet day one was so horrible (down then very poor speed) I had to use a wework space at the last minute. We reset the router and got the internet to work upstairs only on day 2. (I guess they consider the plastic folding table in the family room with a monitor (but no cables) the office!!!??? instead of the actual architectural office on the main floor that is secluded and designed for this purpose? this defeats the purpose of having a dedicated work space if in order to use the it people can not watch tv on the only tv in a common space. <br/>*yard not useable, it has an only sink countertop laying against the fence like a junkyard and it's full of weeds so you can't even access the fire pit and it would be a fire hazard if you did. <br/>*broken window in laundry room and door to bedroom by kitchen didn't close (door doesn't fit the jam) made was concerning<br/>* kitchen - beautiful but refrigerator didn't make ice or dispense water and dishes were dirty it was super unorganized, used odwella bottles in the cabinets and multiple jars with mold in them. <br/>THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM AIRBNB'S PLATFORM IT DOES NOT MEET THEIR STANDARDS.",2021-08,-0.7932,1795,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The worst part for me was that she told me at 10 pm this was the way it would be in the morning after she left at 6am! She could have told me she would be gone (and the dog would yap) when I booked it, and not when it was too late to get a new place. <br/>I can tell that she is a generally nice person, but false advertisement is a deception that hurts people. I tried putting cotton balls in my ears so I could go back to sleep, and even covering my head with a pillow, and then I tried running the bathroom fan and playing music on my laptop, but the dog's high pitched yapping pierced through everything. I was unable to sleep. It seems that when Nikki is there, the dog is calm and doesn't bark. Unfortunately for me, she had a craft fair for which she was leaving at 6am and was gone until check-out.

The hammock, tree house for the kids, the fruit trees, the garden, and the roosters in the next yard added a nice rustic feel to the home.   We did not find any issues with the neighbors.   The pool did require daily skimming  due to the trees, which we did not particularly find problematic.  The pool was surprisingly cool, so we did end up paying the $200/day fee to heat, which did seem very steep.   There were, however, some issues.  The house is a bit worn and in desperate need of a coat of paint on the interior.  The home was clean upon arrival but not spectacularly clean (dust and some dirt on the floors).    There were no Sonos speakers on the inside or outside of the home as descibed.  When I contacted GuestSpaces, they informed us that a prior guest left a speaker in the rain and they were replacing.  They sent a very cheap speaker from Amazon the following day.   The biggest issue is that a sewer pipe was broken in the backyard and shooting ""filtered"" sewer water into the air and down the yard towards the pool.  It would happen intermittently.  We immediately contacted GuestSpace on Sunday.  They informed us that it was a known issue and that somebody was coming out on Monday.  They ultimately came on a Tuesday.   I explained my frustration that this should have been communicated up front (children playing in a yard with E.coli spraying into the air did not seem ideal).  Overall, communication was not great with GuestSpaces (sewer issue and the speaker) and detracted from our stay.

I have stayed in tons of Airbnb’s over the years and never had an experience as strange as this one. To start- the closets were filled with stuff. In fact, so full there was no space in the closets or drawers to hang or unpack our suitcases. The bathroom cabinet was filled with the owners items so there was no where to place our toilet trees. The only place we might have been able to place anything in the bathroom was behind the mirror but it was very dirty with rust and dead bugs. The frig and freezer were filled with food. Their mail and amazon packages were being delivered while we were staying there. The place had clearly not been cleaned by a professional as there was grim and dirt throughout the house, lightbulbs were burnt out in every room and the kitchen needed painting. For $350 per night, we had basically paid their rent while they went on vacation. On a positive note, the location was convenient although close to the highway so you could hear the traffic if you were sitting in the backyard. If you stay here, you don’t need to worry about packing a suitcase because you’ll have everything you need from clothes and shoes toothbrush and toothpaste, food and drink, yoga mat and first aid kit, repair tools and kitchen supples. If you’re looking to travel light, this is the place for you.

On the plus side was there were two bathrooms which have a sink and toilet in each and a shower that is shared.  The beds were very comfortable and it was in a walkable location to 6th street and Rainey street.<br/>It was disappointing that the apartment is not bright like it does in the photo. Windows are one side of apt which faces a high rise so there no sunlight that comes in and thus the apt looks really dark, dreary and depressing.  The apt is very old and not well maintained at all.  We had several issues during our 4 night stay.  The morning after we checked in, we noted that the shower curtain and the liner was covered in mold and not just a small patch – it was widespread, and the tub being narrow, you couldn’t help touching it while you are in the shower.  I notified the owner and the response was he ordered a new one but it probably wouldn’t arrive before we left.  I guess he hadn’t heard of amazon prime. Above the shower is a large patch of mold – it looks like the upstairs may have had a leak in the past and the mold is bigger than my hand.   The tv wouldn’t connect to cable, and we notified the owner early on day 2 and he responded that he would send someone over – nobody showed up for a day and half  so I emailed him next day and notified him of that and he stated that he had the cable provider do a remote reset.  He had never informed us of it. The communication is a big problem – the lack thereof.  The tv was finally able to connect to the cable but then you couldn’t see the full screen or turn the channel – we informed the owner and sent screen shots and no response. The bathroom mat was filthy so we had to wear slippers when using the bathroom, and whomever cleaned the apartment left a used kcup in the Keurig, so you can deduce the lack of cleanliness in this apartment.    The kitchen cabinets are very old and water damaged and the interior looks really old as well.  The toilet tank cover was cracked, and the outlet in the bathroom was moving all over the place and seemed unsafe to use. When you flush the toilet the entire time the tank is filling up you hear the most loud excruciating sound from the pipes so if you do use it when others are asleep its bound to wake them up.  The straw that broke the camels back was that the electricity went out on us and their untimely response hastened us to leave a day early for other accommodations since based on previous communications from the owner, they were so untimely we didn’t want to wait indefinitely in the dark.  We were informed the next day from the owner that the meter was tampered with and that energy was restored within 2 hours after I initiated communication with him again.

One cutting board, no vegetable peeler, minimal cooking utensils, no cookie sheets, just to name a few.  The wine cooler does not work.<br/><br/>3) Much of the furnishings are tired.

I thanked her but told her we were unable to use as there were no glasses in the room. She got very upset that they had gotten ice when we had no glasses.

I walked down driveway so driver wouldn’t leave. She called to me from top of driveway (room in back of house end of driveway). Wanted me to come back to lock door. Since she was there for that purpose told her we had to leave. She told me to come back so she could show me how to lock. I told her we had to go and would figure it out later. She later texted me upset that I was leaving room unlocked. However, I saw her at top of driveway, she spoke to me and had come to lock the door so I figured all was well. If I was going to leave place unlocked I would not have called her in the first place. As it was she was standing near the doorway as we left and she had said she would lock. When we got back late that evening, I figured out how to lock door and texted that information to her so she wouldn’t worry about the place being unlocked. I also told her in the text that the room was still cold (near midnight) and she said she turned up the heat around 6. At that time she texted and asked if temp was okay but we left right after that. She was very upset that I texted her late at night. I was not expecting a response at that hour. Was just letting her know that it hadn’t warmed up so she could kept that in mind for future guests when the weather is chilly. On a minor note, there was no hairdryer in the room as listed but that was promptly remedied. We had to put our suitcases on the floor as there was no place to sit them.

The host was aware of this but chose not to inform us and didn't do anything to get rid of the smell before our arrival. The host was slow to respond and refused to refund the entire amount we paid even though we could only stay for 15 minutes because the smell was too overwhelming.

Upon entering, it was VERY inviting, updated, clean, and the beds were VERY professional made! However, we soon learned that both beds were VERY noisy and the king bed was the most uncomfortable bed we have ever slept in. In bed, we started rolling towards each other in the middle. We lifted the mattress and found it to be on slats (not box springs) and there was a broken slat in the middle. (We didn't want maintenance to come at that hour, as we were already in bed.) So, we tried 1 across the top/1 across the bottom. Then, the neighbor's dog started barking outside nonstop for 15 minutes. My husband moved to the living room floor with just a sheet from the king bed (no extra bedding).

Aside from the Airbnb not being cleaned prior to my arrival, the broken bathroom amenities, and the host’s uncooperative nature - allow me to express the worst part of my whole trip. I had a security incident where the other guest’s actions had compromised my belongings. Due to the unwillingness of the host to fix the front door and negligent behavior of the other guests, the front door to the Airbnb was left wide open late at night twice. Not only did this cause a huge influx of insects to flood the property and rooms but also it also gave me a very uncomfortable/unsafe feeling to continue my stay. This event occurred closer to midnight on my first night so I immediately reached out to the host, packed my belongings, and left the premises. Since I had been visiting from out of state, I needed to find other accommodation so I took an Uber to a nearby hotel and booked a stay there. The next day after long, unproductive conversations with the host and AirBnB support, I made the decision that I was not returning to the dingy, unkept Airbnb. In the end, I had not even stayed a single night in the Airbnb out of my 8 night booking, and the host refused to provide me with a full refund nor a partial.

It was left under the mat on the front porch which felt extremely unsafe especially when he asked us to leave it there for the AC repair man while we were out to dinner and all of our belongings were in the house.  After the AC was deemed to be unfixable, the host did agree to a full refund because we cancelled our trip within the first 24 hours.

We were snowed/iced into our neighborhood and were having issues getting out of the neighborhood due to snow icing on the streets. We actually got stranded in the home for our whole stay having to walk to a grocery store for food due to the roads being blocked with ice and snow. Matt pressured us into leaving on the day of our supposed check out so that another air bnb visitor could stay. A local who lost power during the storm.  We messaged back and forth with Matt that morning and told him our concern about not being able to drive out of the neighborhood safely even at noon and he basically told us that she would be checking in at some point that day so we would either have to leave or let her inside the home. We are in a pandemic and we weren’t comfortable letting someone we had no clue who she interacted with into the house with our one year old daughter. The new guest drove up at 11 as we were packing our things making the whole situation very uncomfortable as we were still trying to work things out with Matt. We didn’t even know if we could get out of the neighborhood as the only exit included a steep climb that was iced and people kept sliding down when they attempted to drive up it. The house had not been cleaned or anything and she walked in right after we were able to gather our belongings. The new guest felt horrible because she had no idea she was basically kicking someone else out to be stranded in the middle of winter storm with no place to go and also knew we would have to attempt to exit the neighborhood in a treacherous winter storm.  It was very scary and we expressed our concerns with Matt throughout but he never took ownership, avoided our calls only messaging us, and tried to blame us saying we told him we were leaving when I have the message exchange never did we say that. The Only things we discussed was that we would try to leave but that we might not be able to due to the icy roads that had not been cleared yet.  I’m worried about this host because 1. He has no concern for our safety even we I approached him prior to staying about concerns on house preparations for the cold weather he blew it off then messaged me in a frenzy after the fact to prepare his house in the midst of the storm 2. The fact the house was not cleaned in between our stay and the next person in the middle of dangerous pandemic makes me question if he even cleaned it prior to our arrival. 3.  The fact that the sink broke during our stay due to his ill preparations prior to the freeze and no apology or concern was raised. And he let the next guest go in to a broke sink.  <br/>I understand that this was a crazy storm that Austin has never seen but Matt was not interested at all in our well-being and didn’t even check with us before letting someone else book the place knowing that the neighborhood was barely even accessible due to the road conditions.  He came across as a money hungry person looking to get his next dollar and toss the people he already collected from aside.

A blue, stiff loveseat now is in the living room. CATFISHED. Let me not forget the huge branch dangling over the yard just waiting to fall on your head! BYOHH (bring your own hard hat). Our biggest upset is that we told Alan about the pools condition and branch right away and he kept lying about it. ""It will clear up by tonight"" then ""it will clear up by tomorrow""... Shouldn't it have been clear and ready to use BY our check in time? And he admitted to be aware of it, to boot. Said he was at the house 5 days in a row checking the pool... maybe it was the other recent review that calls out the green pool. Said that getting a landscaper was hard lately. So I filed a complaint with AirBNB during our stay... Alan declined the refund I was fairly requested trying to give me a so story that this ""is his livelihood."" Like I'm some millionaire? We just wanted the pool in the pics, is that so much to ask! AND THEN he sent men to the house at 8:30am on day 3 of our stay, with NO notice to us, to take down the branch. I thought it was hard to get landscapers? Guess not. Waking up to strange men in the backyard using a chainsaw in a tree outside our master bedroom was terrifying, esp to a group of 9 women. A total invasion of privacy! I've contacted AirBNB about this several times now and they don't seem to care... It's incredibly upsetting. There should be some kind of standard that hosts are held to. Homes should be walked to ensure that the advertised photos are what's being delivered. If that were the case, Alan's home would not be listed OR he would need to remedy the current status of it to make it worth the amount he charges for it. Do not book this AirBNB unless you genuinely don't care about having a pool or are cool jumping into a green pool you can't see the bottom of. One more time, say it with me... CATFISHED. Good work, ""Superhost"" Alan... Enjoy the money you made off our group. You should be ashamed.",2022-09,-0.9782,3692,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

After I booked this listing, Meshelle shared that she had made changes to the listing and linked to a private website with revised photos.

I would have never booked this listing if I had known what the actual listing was and how it was designed and furnished.  You pay a premium for a Plus listing based on the design, and to have the photos so significantly differ from the actuality was extremely disappointing and I felt unfairly charged a premium for an experience I didn't actually receive. I messaged Airbnb immediately at check-in about the issue, and they agreed that the listing was misrepresented, however, given their unresponsiveness despite multiple follow-ups, I wasn't able to move to a new accommodation until the following afternoon. In addition, I was not refunded the service fee, cleaning fee, or first night's stay given Airbnb saying that the host refused the refund.

The rest of the days the hot water came in and out during showers. <br/><br/>The listing indicated 3 queen beds which was a key criterion for our choice of rental but in reality there were only 2 queen beds. The listing claims the primary/main bedroom to have a memory foam mattress but it does not. The mattress in that room is very, very uncomfortable. My husband and I, who were visiting our daughter at UT, along with her grandparents from the East Coast, slept very poorly because the mattress is dented in the middle and within 2 minutes each of us kept sliding into the middle. The mattress in the primary bedroom was also very dilapidated and worn and it felt as though we could feel the springs. Definitely NOT a memory foam mattress! <br/><br/>We are calm, caring, and reasonable people, most of my family are educators, working at very reputable institutions. We do not like to raise concerns to the level of a bad review and I told Jill I didn’t want to leave a bad review-that was my response to her when she told me how bad it was for her business when people leave bad reviews. I resisted leaving a negative review until now because in spite of Airbnb’s Aircover policy the company is offering me, for all of these issues, only 20% off of two of our 4 day stay because of the hot water issues. This, in and of itself is highly problematic. Any reputable business would recognize that hot water is fundamentally an expectation. <br/><br/>It wasn’t just the hot water which was highly problematic but also, the bed issue, as well as the main bathroom tub being unusable when we wanted to use it to boil water to pour into it to take a warm bath when the hot water was out. There was no way to plug the tub.<br/><br/>In addition, the office that was advertised as part of the rental was not useable because it was full of baby gear and there were personal   Items on the desk including a credit card bill.

The home just wasn’t clean. The fans and vents had thick dust on them so we didn’t want to turn them on. The kitchen window ledge by the sink was covered crud and dead bugs. The countertops were dirty and the silverware were not clean. The kitchen supplies to cook was subpar and had to buy our supplies to clean the dishes. There was radon junk under the kitchen sink like old bowls of bacon grease and old sponges. There was old food in the pantry so we couldn’t store our food.

There would have been no cost on your part, as you would have easily been able to obtain another booking in in 7 1/2 months. We just had to bite the bullet and make the most of it. <br/>The apartment has difficult steps, carrying stuff up and down them during our visit was difficult. But, I was glad we didn't take your offer of a downstairs one, as I would not have felt safe to me. There were frequently men in the parking lot, looking at cars,  picking up keys, working on cars, etc.<br/>The door lock system worked beautifully, but was concerned what would happen if the the battery ran out? Would we be able to get in? We assumed the key on the wall behind the door would open it and kept it with us. Does a blinking red light mean it needs a new battery?<br/>Having a bad knee as we stated in trying to cancel, I had to do exercises on the carpet. I could see dark spots - wondered  when it had been last cleaned? Didn't have any extra sheets or blankets to possibly place on floor as a cover-that would have helped. The bed very comfortable, but torn comforter and no duvet cover seems a bit unsanitary.<br/>The two sofas in the living room are terribly uncomfortable, springs broken on one, cover cracking apart on the other, need to be replaced. The small kitchen table was that, small . It was the only place we had to work and not large enough. Two of the four chairs had bent legs and one actually couldn't be used.<br/>Staying in a place for a month requires cleaning supplies to be provided. It is unreasonable to think a person is to go out any buy cleaning products for toilet, bath, sinks in kitchen and bathroom, and countertops especially during a pandemic.<br/>The clock on the wall indicated 12:10 the whole time we were there. You need to replace the battery that was missing.<br/>There are dribbles of some kind of dark liquid running down the back of the closet, stains on the bathroom closets and paper and dust behind the chest in the closet , as I found in retrieving  a necklace that fell behind it.<br/>In searching for all items in the bedroom as we packed up, I found a strip of crust from an old piece of toast from some previous lodgers.<br/>The trash can in the kitchen had mold on the inside upper lid which I could have cleaned had you provided disinfectant and rubber gloves, which we asked for some and you said you would bring over - it never happened. It wouldn't have been quite as nasty if the foot pedal worked, but it didn't We had to lift the lid with our hands each time.<br/>Insufficient cutlery - 3 spoons, 5 forks, 4 steak knives, 4 knives. No strainer. No washing up tub for a few dishes had to run the dishwasher for the few chipped bowls and plates. We borrowed mugs from friends and left them , so you now have 4 instead of the two you provided. No dish towels or hand towels in kitchen. Frying pan needs to be replaced - eggs constantly sticking.  <br/>The wall switch runs the wifi - that was frustrating until we figured it out.<br/>If you are looking for a convenient location this is it. If you care about cleanliness and a feeling of comfort, don't even think about staying here. When we originally booked an Airbnb in our old hometown, our thoughts of having people over to visit with us and share meals was not possible in this place. We were not able to change it once we realized our mistake. So CAUTION  on a monthly stay- don't push book it because you will not be able to cancel after 48 hours - EVEN WITH OVER 7 MONTHS NOTICE.<br/>We were Superhosts for three years with over 200 guests in our home and never did we ever have as much difficulty  and lack of support with Airbnb as we did with Casey and this rental.<br/>We are tying to stay positive that this is a one-off.",2021-12,-0.6881,3962,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

Upon first look, it seems like the unit is part of a house but the unit itself is actually behind the house pictured. Upon arrival you’ll see the door is in very bad shape. It barely closes which easily allows bugs in & will only slightly close due to the deadlock. We felt very uncomfortable leaving electronics behind in the space due to the fact it would likely be very easy to break into.<br/>The host does provide earplugs due to the fact that it’s directly next door to a fraternity house which we didn’t mind too much.<br/>Since the space is old & has hardwood floors throughout the noise from the neighboring apartments is incredibly loud. The walls are thinner than paper per say. It was frustrating that the neighbors, especially those above the unit, had no respect for others in the building. Lots of noise from 7 am on on a Saturday morning. We were looking forward to sleeping in a bit for the weekend & found it was nearly impossible due to hearing lots of conversation & shuffling very early in the morning.<br/>On top of that, the parking was so difficult. Don’t even attempt to park in the driveway because there’s almost no space & unless you have a sedan it will be very difficult to get out of once you’re in. With that, since it’s located right next to a fraternity house, there’s almost no parking available on the street. In addition, it’s very worrisome parking on the street itself due to the drinking & driving that occurred during the night.<br/>Lastly, the only available sink was the bathroom sink. They have cups & mugs available to use to make coffee/tea but no water besides the bathroom faucet to use for such things. With that, we weren’t certain how to clean anything without any kind of actual sink or dish soap for the dishes. It was very frustrating.<br/>Although the bed was comfortable, the bad certainly outweighed the good. I would not consider this place worth its price, it should really be half that. I would suggest just getting a hotel or a better Airbnb & pass on this place. I hate to leave a bad review but I do want people to be aware of what they’re getting into.

It’s plugged into the wall about 3 feet away and seems sketchy. So 5 of us had to shower in 1 shower instead of 2 as stated. There also was many things that were just poorly cared for such as big pictures randomly falling off the wall and the handle to the balcony coming off.

In my history of Airbnb, I have never had to leave a negative review or call Airbnb to complain about a host. Yvette knows I am going to be honest about my experience and in return I'm assuming she will be leaving me a negative review in return. I informed the host I would arrive between 9 am-1 pm because I was traveling from out of town. She was fine with this as her post says check in starts at 8 am. Upon arriving to her home, the front yard area was cluttered with random tools and junk. I called to let her know I arrived but she didn't answer. After knocking, she showed me to the room. The comforter had two big holes on it and the room had a strange smell, but that didn't really bother me. The TV did not have access to Netflix, Hulu,  etc. Be careful with the shower,  the water pressure is very strong. After seeing the common areas, I realized that the host sleeps in the living room with her bf. There was a huge bed in the living room which made it uncomfortable to even attempt to hang out there. The backyard had a private area for the dogs and a trampoline, however, it had clothing hanging all over it. I just didn't feel comfortable leaving the room at all. So I was gone for most of my stay exploring Austin. I believe that is why the host didn't add pictures of the common areas to her post, which should have been a red flag for me. Also, the ad stated it was pet-friendly, but her dogs kept being aggressive towards my dog, barking loudly, trying to bite him, and ganging up  on him. It bothered me that the host did nothing to calm her dogs down. My dog is completely trained AKC certified Canine Good Citizen and emotional support. He was afraid of her dogs. So again, I felt trapped in the room. Any slight movement I or my dog made, Yvette's dogs were barking up a storm. Even to the point that I had to leave at 2:40 am because I couldn't sleep with all the noise. Also, the Host did not mention prior to the booking that 3 people were living there. Her, her boyfriend, and her son. Around midnight, I had to text the host because the walls are paper thin and I could hear a loud conversation between them and that her dogs kept barking. Host did not stop her dogs from barking all night when my dog never barked at them. I felt like I was walking on eggshells in that room. It doesn't help that this room is right next to the kitchen. The next day around noon, two hours before my check out time, the hosts texts me to apologize about her dogs barking all night, stating how she didn't even want the dogs and how they don't have any training. I appreciated the apology but it did nothing to resolve the fact that I was not able to get any rest in the room I paid for. After that,  she became very defensive and cooky on text and was threatening to leave me a bad review. Just unprofessional and I honestly wish I would have called Airbnb at 2:40 in the morning to complain or paid much more for an actual dog-friendly stay. She didn't even offer a discount for the stay. Just be cautious if you decide to book this place. Pros: host leaves you snacks, coffee, and plenty of toiletries in the room.

He was apathetic to the fact I could not find the place and if not for Maribel, the other host, I would’ve cancelled and found another spot in the middle of the night. <br/>The place itself was nice & spacious for the most part.

The apartment is well kept, clean upon arrival and the appliance all worked well.  The bed was comfortable and there was great water pressure in the shower. Overall, it was a very comfortable place to stay.  <br/><br/>There are two issues that need to be addressed to make it a five-star experience: <br/>1) The cooking pans need work or a refresh, see the attached picture. We picked this place to be able to cook our meals here and I spent a good amount of time working on cleaning the largest fry pan with a SOS pad so we could use it. Not a big issue but when you’re paying over $290 a day (we were in Austin during a peak period), you don’t expect to scrub the pots and pans when you arrive. <br/><br/>2) The second and bigger issue is the driveway.  Many homes in Austin have the two parking pads down the center of their driveways and, if you look at them throughout the neighborhood, you will see they are gravel fill at the same level as the pads. But, the parking pads in this driveway are missing the gravel filling that is supposed to be on both sides of the pads.  There is up to a 4-5 inch drop off on each side and the concrete edge has a sharp line at the top. This was a real problem for our sedan’s tires when making a 90 degree turn at the end of the driveway to turn onto the pads in the area designated for this apartment.  The sharp edges of each concrete pads could be heard rubbing loudly on the sides of the tires when turning into this area. You can see this has been a problem for other cars based on the black marks worn into each pad. We stopped using this area as soon as we <br/>discovered this issue. I'm hoping our car tires were not damaged, but have yet to go to the tire store and have them inspected.  Dumping a load of gravel to fill in between the pads and bring this area up to the proper grade will solve this problem and prevent damage to other guest's tires in the future. <br/><br/>The owner sent me a message that they intend to fix both issues in the future.",2022-10,-0.6797,2143,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

Unfortunately, I am giving a horrible review because of the people who manage this property. The first issue we ran into was terrible Internet speed. I had to make a couple of work-related video conferencing calls and wasn't able to do so because of the poor connection. I looked for a modem and couldn't locate it anywhere. I reached out to the listing customer support and was told to check the closets. Well, this wasn't really helpful as I have already spent a ton of time checking their closets before reaching out to their support. This back and forth happened around 8pm and my last message just got ignored. The next day I woke up and discovered that the entire apartment didn't have any water. I called their property manager to report an issue and was told to hold off until they check with the building management. I called them back an hour later and they told me that there was nothing they could as the entire building got affected and that I should ""sit tight"". I asked them again about the modem location and my message got ignored one more time. I was patient and had to ask them for the third time why they are ignoring my question about the modem. This time they answered back and said it was somewhere in the living room. Given that the apartment is really small, this wasn't helpful at all. I asked them to be more specific and they said that only cleaning people knew about the modem location and that they couldn't get in touch with them because of the bad weather. At the same time, we got a message from them to prepare for a potential power outage without actually telling us what needs to be done. An hour later I called back to check on the water outage status. My call got picked up by Rose who appeared to be extremely rude and unprofessional. She wasn't capable of having a conversation with a frustrated customer. Moreover, she said that THEY were 'patient with US' (her direct quote), and in the end, she advised us to call Airbnb if we weren't happy and HUNG UP on us. They haven't done anything to alleviate our frustration: they could offer a discount or an option of an early check out with a refund for the last day. Instead, they did NOTHING and presented themselves as someone who didn't know how to deal with unhappy customers. Property management is totally incompetent when it comes to handling critical issues.

He ended up not charging us because he saw in the camera that we didn’t have any malicious intents for going into the garage. He charged me another 200 dollars because the hot tub was cloudy, but when we first arrived to the house the hot tub was already cloudy (the owner claims it wasn’t even though he never went to check the house before turning it over). This place is really nice but it’s a trap, they will try to get every dollar they can off of you.

My sister's small dog also had an accident (pee) that we missed because it was under a step stool, also charged an extra $100 cleaning fee for them to mop it up, which again they should be sweeping and mopping between guests, anyways.

Firstly, the host fails to take any pictures of the exterior of the property clearly on purpose (because, if they did, nobody would book it). It's an chainlink fence surrounded by uninhabited buildings in an area infested by homeless people. As a group of grown men, we felt uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Next up, prepare for an interior with grease and slime on the walls, broken floorboards, and nothing in the apartment working - we had to fix the toilet, the TV never worked, etc. Also, the backyard is at best a 4"" x 12""x porch with just a few chairs (nothing like what is pictured in the photos). <br/><br/>However, most importantly, this home is NOT SAFE. Within 1-HOUR of being on the property, we had two homeless people walk into our backyard, shoot heroine IN FRONT OF US WHILE WE WERE ASKING THEM TO LEAVE, and, after they were does, they confronted us. It was very clear that this is their regular spot where they do drugs (which the host failed to inform us of) and when we informed the host, she provided no security nor lock for the property - we had to purchase one ourselves because we felt so unsafe. Had it not been a weekend where we would not be able to find any alternative accommodations given the race in town, we would have left immediately. <br/><br/>While the host is reasonable at responding, it's very clear she does not want to help in any way to remedy the security of the property and prefers to let guests figure it out themselves after they book.

We were there with kids, multiple age groups. We were ready to pay $$$ for our 2 night stay expecting nice stay.<br/><br/>House was clean, has nice view from the living room. However there are  few reasons we were not happy in fact frustrated with the host.<br/><br/>On 2nd night, one for the room got locked. We started communicating with host again and she asked us to try many things like use credit card to open door, search for master key  in the house( no clue where it is), try random pass code to open, etc etc, non of them worked and host stopped responding. Whole night room got locked. Unfortunately we had kids medicine in there and communicated the same with host. She relay didn’t care about it. We ended up going out in the middle of the night to get the medicine. Locksmith came next morning and unlocked it. We had really bad experience for 1 day in our 2 days stay.<br/><br/>When We started getting into the pool, it was not hot enough for us. Reached out to Host to adjust the temperature. If guests has control to adjust pool temperature, it brings lot of piece of mind. Guests are in holiday mood and don’t want to spend lot of time in communicating with host. <br/><br/>Another thing is, jacuzzi. We have no clue how to switch on jacuzzi. Followed instructions provided on little iPad but there was no luck. Again started communicating with host and after lengthy conversation, host revealed that jacuzzi is not good and jets had lot of pressure. We were okay with it and asked host to switch on. Host surprised that jacuzzi was not working. Next day some one came to fix it and it worked for couple of hours and again stopped working. Host simply said issues like this is acceptable in big houses like this. Kids  totally missed the fun. Kids were not able to use pool also since it is too deep.<br/><br/>Overall, house is decent but response from the host was very poor and she didn’t understand the situation we were in.

Sections of the rug and bedroom bench had large stains on them. The host failed to inform us that the deck has rot and mold growing under the structure and would be unusable.  The deck amenities were a selling point for selecting this property.  We were not notified of this until 30 minutes prior to our check-in.  The deck area is almost one-half of the entire upstairs area. The overall interior of the downstairs and upstairs felt as if the home hasn't been occupied in several months. We left the property within an hour of checking in and were forced to make last minute hotel accommodations.  We immediately informed the host when we arrived of this situation and his remedy was to refund us the $100 cleaning fee, which he did, since it appeared that this home was not cleaned prior to our arrival.

I arrived on a Thursday after dark. There were no exterior lights on in the front of the house except for a dimly lit lamp post in the front yard. The neighborhood is dark and the houses are on larger lots and set back from the street. I  had been instructed to park on the street and enter the property through the rear of the house. I walked up the long driveway and around the back of the house and at no time did a motion sensing light come on. There was no light at the back door but with the flashlight from my phone I managed to find the keys and unlock the back door. When I stepped into the darkened house there did not appear to be anyone else around. I found the bedroom and got settled in, but wondered if the owners would be home later in the evening. Incidentally, the hall light outside the bedroom door was also non-functioning. I felt a bit apprehensive and did not sleep well. The next morning when I left the house to attend my workshop I still had not seen nor heard anyone. That evening, when I returned to the house it was the same scenario - no lights, the house was dark and silent. Finally on Saturday I texted the owner to ask if they were gone for the weekend and should I expect anyone else to be at the house. She texted back and said that they were out of town and that no one would be at the house until Sunday. On Saturday evening I arrived at the house at dusk to find a car parked in the driveway that had NOT been there earlier in the day, after I had been told that no one would be at the house. I was a little freaked out so I texted the owner again to ask about the car in the driveway and she texted that their daughter who attended UT had taken the car to get it serviced and then returned it to the house. Well, that would have been nice to know, especially since she said that NO ONE would be at the house. After that incident I felt completely uncomfortable staying in the home, so I packed up my things and left a night early. I found the entire experience very inhospitable and a lot of my uneasiness could have been alleviated if the hosts had only COMMUNICATED with me and left some lights on!  Other observations: the guest bedroom appeared to be vacated room of aforementioned college-aged daughter. It was pretty bare-bones and, with the exception of the bed (which was very comfortable), it appeared to look pretty much the way it looked after she moved to college - posters on the wall, a dusty bookshelf with AP English books on it, a little desk. etc. The room and the bathroom across the hall were fairly clean - the house appeared to be about 40 years old and hasn't had a lot of updating.

Two days of back and forth with Sonder to get the issue resolved.. and it wasn't resolved to my satisfaction. The first 2 nights the AC blew only cold air, despite someone coming into fix it (when I asked what they'd done and when they'd come in, no one could tell me which makes me suspect they didn't do anything at all). When I contacted Sonder the 2nd night, they told me about a portable heater in the kitchen which I could use in the interim. When I explained it was a 2 bedroom apartment and we would need 2 heaters, they seemed stumped about that. They offered a code to a ""nearby"" apartment to go in and retrieve the heater from the ""empty"" apartment. Even though it was empty we were not able to stay in that apartment for the night, but could go to one 17miles away, but only for one night. We declined the offer to move. Given that it is Texas I also declined the offer to enter a so-called empty apartment and requested they go and bring me a new heater from the store. They did bring a heater that night at almost midnight which was really not fun to wait around in the cold for someone with an unknown ETA. The next day (day 3) I had to prompt them to get someone out to fix the heat... they confirmed at 1pm that the  issue was fixed. We returned home at 9pm to an tropical apartment. The vents were finally blowing hot air, but the system was not recognizing that the temperature was reached and continued to blow hot air (I had the system on ""auto"" so it should recognize when its at the requested temperature). Despite turning the thermostat down to 65F, it continued to blow 90F + air through the night until I finally gave up and turned it off. The next day (day 4) the outside temperature had risen above 53F (which was also the inside temp of the apartment the first 2 days just FYI) so I gave up with trying to get anything solved. I went to Austin for a scientific conference and spent 2 days trying to sort out a heating issue in the apartment so didn't really learn much. After contacting Airbnb, they made Sonder refund 50% of the first 2 nights fee (inadequate compensation in my opinion). Given that the premise of Airbnb is renting out other people's homes and not corporate entities renting out their numerous apartments, having Sonder on here when you can also book them on booking.com and through Sonder's website goes against the premise of Airbnb and I will never stay in a Sonder again. Also, there was mold on the shower curtain but I didn't take a picture because I was more concerned with getting them to fix the heat. One star.",2019-11,-0.6162,2658,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The worst was the security fail, which was surprising considering all the steps they make you take to verify you before checking in. The doors are operated by keypad and mine was broken the entire stay. I was unable to lock my door when leaving the property every time, having to leave my belongings exposed. There were also no blinds on the glass doors downstairs that left the ground level wide open to neighbors and i felt uncomfortable being down there with lights on at night since there was zero privacy on that floor. Every time i got home i was paranoid someone might have gotten in and so ran through the apt opening every closet door and i locked myself in the bedroom each night, but the windows didn’t open so i couldn’t get any fresh air. The apartment itself was fine, but clearly one of those Airbnb rentals that feels like it’s been left to fall apart and no one cares - all the fixtures on the tub/ sink etc were  loose and dirty, there was a mild case of black mold forming on the tiles near the bathtub upstairs, there was a coffee maker but no tea kettle…The bed was okay, not the most comfortable but also not the worst.

The hosts weren’t able to get it fixed prior to the big Texas snow storm (one day before the storm) and verbally told my husband (since they live next door) that they would refund the days the hot water was out. We left the space with three days remaining when the roads were safe, as there was still no power and no fix for the hot water heater scheduled. Unfortunately, since this was said verbally and not written in a message in the AirBnB app, the hosts were able to go back on their word and only gave a refund for the days we not there. We figured since they were so nice they would honor their word, but they didn’t. It’s sad that this is our first poor AirBnB experience and to have a host that was less than amenable in a terrible situation. He didn’t respond to messages quickly to have a discussion and accidentally called my husband thinking he was a plumber 6 days after the last message we sent. After he realized his mistake, he hung up on him, and then didn’t answer when he called him back.

Ok having said that now for the apartment itself. This apartment is very tiny as it is depicted in the pictures.

We wanted to cook until we saw the cookware on top of the refrigerator. My expectations would not have been nearly as high if this were a $40 or even $50 stay but $100 Absolutely not! We were so disappointed that we didn’t even stay for the night because we just felt so uncomfortable.

He even called us back on our cell phone rather than email to let us know that he was going to be in constant contact to let us know when we can get into a place. We initially thought it would take maybe an hour or two. We I have two small children and had just arrived after  a very long drive. We were exhausted and we're hoping to be able clean up, rest up and then enjoy the city. Unfortunately, 4 hours later we hadn't heard from him  even after we called him several times without a response. We then attempted to contact him by email. We had expected a phone call to let us know when we can go back but then around 9 we noticed he finally emailed us. To our dismay, he informed us that his phone had been off and he just put it back on and that our room was now verified clean.

And to make matters worse the next morning while my husband was in the shower the water was shut off and when we try to contact Kevin he was not answering his cell phone. It took him about over 15 minutes to get back to us. When he finally did contact us  he let us know  that he was going to send a maintenance man .

This was actually my worst air bnb experience thus far. Kevin was very slow to respond to me and as a guest, it was weird to feel like a burden after simply asking for things that should have been readily available already. This was especially difficult when we realized the extra sheets and pillows Kevin promised us for the air mattresses were not accessible but instead inside of a locked closet. Although I first inquired about these around 3 pm, he did not message me back until 1:30 am with where the keys for the closet were, when we were already asleep. We ended up having to take blankets off of the beds and use those for the air mattresses. In addition, the machine that blew up the mattress had dead batteries inside of it. Therefore, we had to drive to a store and use our personal money to purchase more batteries. Not only was this an inconvenience but when I asked Kevin to reimburse for the batteries (two times) he completely ignored me and I still have not heard back from him.

It afforded our family a ground floor, quiet place to stay with more room and more convenience than we could have gotten by booking two adjoining rooms in a hotel. However, we encountered several problems that were inconvenient to say the least. A family that is tired from a day of traveling across country should not have to drive to a Walmart to buy blankets for their beds before they can bed down for the night. An elderly couple should not feel that their bathroom commode might just fall over as they sit down or alight from it. Six guests that wish to freshen up after a long travel day should have six sets of linens at their disposal. Guests should not expect maintenance to have to spend several hours the morning after their arrival fixing items that should have been attended to ahead of their stay. Guests should not be awoken after they are in bed by a man claiming to be the ""cleaner"" who then gets angry and slams the door as he is leaving when he had the combination to the locked linen closet and could have at the very least kept the elderly guest whose blanket was not on his bed from spending his first night cold.",2021-03,-0.6124,1263,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The kitchen was dirty, there was leftover food from the last renters, crumbs and splatter marks in the drawers and cabinets. So, we washed the dishes we used prior to using them. The stove was rusty and spattered and there was only a 4-cup coffee maker. There was only half a role of paper towel and half a roll of toilet paper when we arrived, but the owner did have someone drop off more. A day or so into our stay the power in half the kitchen went out so we had to move the microwave and coffee maker to different outlets, but the most unsettling was the animal the got into the roof.  The animal climbed through a hole in screen just under the eaves at the end of the house. We heard a boom and scratching and running around during the night.

We were asked to lie if someone asked who we were. Ultimately we decided not to stay the night and due to the high traffic in Austin for SXSW were unable to stay in town so we headed back to the DFW area. We told our host we could not stay the night. When he responded the next day, he agreed to refund us about 1/3 of our reservation.

There was way too much information shared up front via AirBnB messages and over text message (a true AirBnB novel of instructions), especially for my one-night stay, and this not only wasted my time but also made it difficult to find the key info I needed to actually find this very hard-to-find location. <br/><br/>Went to one wrong location that my Google Maps directed me to before navigating myself to what I was sure was the right location, with my building (#11) listed on the front gate. When I finally got to the door, the app I was supposed to use to unlock it didn't work so I called the host but got his voicemail, which made me anxious that I would have no way of getting in if he didn't call me back. Fortunately he called me back a minute later but it turned out I was at the wrong building in the wrong complex, even though it was the same exact door number at the same address as the apartment I was supposed to be in (one was the A side and one was the B side, apparently). I finally made it there but it took about 45-60 minutes longer than almost any other AirBnB I've stayed in and was a very frustrating process to go through right after flying in.<br/><br/>Maybe fine for a longer trip, but for those planning on staying for one or two nights I'd say the check-in process makes booking this location not worth it.",2019-05,-0.9201,1405,6,-36.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

We were blessed to have great communication with our others hosts before arriving to Dallas and Waco in making sure we would be presented with no problems from the storm upon arrival to our airbnbs . However we had major problems upon arriving to Austin . Days prior to our arrival we contacted the host to make sure everything would be ok . Communication was poor . But eventually the host responded and mentioned he had some water issues due to the storm but that everything was resolved and that we were good to go . Upon arrival we opened the door to a musty order that was masked by febreze and cologne. While trying to settle in we stepped into the first bedroom and our socks got drenched. We then realized  the whole carpet was wet .

32642588,595594732,2020-01-20,64557989,Christopher,"My original reservation for this unit was for 3 nights during a vacation in Austin, TX. Unfortunately, I only stayed in it for 30 minutes before setting up other living arrangements. From what I gathered during my short stay was that there is a significant amount of false advertisement. For example, the sleeping space was very tight and the foot of the bed was right up against the wall so the soles of my feet touched the wall. Also, above the foot of the bed was a block window that connected to the interior of the house, not the exterior. There was no covering on this window so I could see when another unit's light was on and vice versa. No blackout curtains were available in my unit, unlike the post mentions. There was another block window near the kitchen area as well. Another issue with the unit was the bathroom area. There was a curtain to draw instead of a door or wall. There were two steps to walk up to be at the toilet. My head touched the ceiling as I stood at the toilet. Across from the toilet was the shower but I had to step down into the shower area. Also, there were blinds/curtains missing on some of the windows across the back of the unit. An exterior issue was that half the walk way behind the house was missing concrete walking stones so I was forced to walk in the dirt/mud to get to the entrance. Also, plastic edging was placed to separate the walkway from the grass and I tripped on this one night because there was no exterior light on that side of the house. Square footage is listed, but no mention of ceiling height to objectively measure just how ""tiny"" this house really is. I attempted to communicate my disappointment with the owner, who did nothing to remedy the unpleasant experience. She was more concerned about how I was going to review her unit on the platform. When I did request a refund of some of the amount, she stated the issue was completely my own and attempted to intimidate me by stating, ""I think it best neither of us leave a review."" Obviously this made me want to leave a review even more. All in all, a terrible first Airbnb experience, and probably the last.<br/><br/>I would like to add that the customer service at AirBnb has been exemplary for addressing and remedying my situation.

Unfortunately, it was obvious that the cleaners had done only those things and left.  The sofa cushions were in disarray and there were food crumbs visible all over the cushions.  The side tables also had food crumbs all over.   There were chunks of dried dirt, hair, and other debris all over the rug and floor.   I opened a dresser drawer and there was a strange, fist-sized ball of hair in it.   There were cobwebs along the baseboards and food particles and hair everywhere.   The refrigerator smelled extremely fishy although the baking soda container in there was helping a bit.   We had nowhere to sit and didn't want to touch anything.<br/><br/>Ames responded quickly and offered to let us cancel and give us a full refund without working with us on how to make the stay work out.  We spent a couple of hours trying to find alternatives and couldn't find anything less than almost 2x the price on such short notice - so we asked him to refund us the first night stay and get us a hotel room for the first night, as we would be happy to keep the rental once cleaned.   He refused and said he wouldn't pay for a hotel, and that we'd only get a refund for the first night if we didn't stay there.   We couldn't afford to go anywhere else, so we just laid towels on the sofa and went to bed early.  I pointed out that he was basically telling us that by not giving any sort of refund or compensation, he was demanding that we pay full price to stay in an uncleaned apartment with no internet service - no response.<br/><br/>Next day, the property manager came by to fix the internet (which was down - but this happens).  The cleaner didn't show up by 2pm, nearly 24 hours after check in, so we left and came back late evening before dinner.  <br/><br/>The cleaners had stopped by... but other than brushing the crumbs off the sofa and table, it didn't appear they had done anything.   The sofa was still messy with loose feathers in the exact same places they'd been before.   The ball of hair was still in the drawer.   The floor was just as dirty as when we'd left.   <br/><br/>At this point, Ames issued a refund for the first night and the cleaning fee - the right thing to do.   It was a pity it took him so long to handle it appropriately.  <br/><br/>Otherwise, the sofa and rug are as permanently filthy as other guests have mentioned.  I mean huge dark stains that just look unsanitary.   The bathroom tile is as yellowed and uncleaned looking as described by others (nothing that can't be deep cleaned - the cleaners just aren't doing it).   Nothing like photos and no one would rent the place in the condition it's actually in.   It's a shame as the apartment is small but comfortable, freshly renovated, and in a good location.<br/><br/>One other thing - there is a frat house of sorts near by and they have backyard parties from around 11pm to 3am.

The beds and the couch were comfortable and provided enough room for all guests. <br/><br/>Cons: I had concerns about this place after I booked as the reviews subsequently were poor. I messaged David in regards to these concerns (specifically people complained about the broken internet, lack of hot water, not enough bath towels, dirty pool) and he assured me (after two days of waiting for a response) these issues would be fixed upon my arrival -- of which, half were fixed... the water was hot, but could scald someone if you weren't careful; the internet didn't work; the pool was dirty; there were, however, enough bath towels. I messaged him on our arrival notifying him of the internet and didn't receive a response from him all weekend. I've NEVER had a host just not respond during my stay if I had a concern/question. <br/><br/>In addition to these issues, there was a kitchen chair laying in the dining room -- completely broken. One of the bathroom windows was broken/wouldn't shut/lock. I found this to be somewhat of a safety concern. The front window panes outside of the living room had been broken in multiple places. The shower head in the bathroom that with the broken window was utterly terrible, poor flow/sprayed in random directions. The house holds up to 16 people, yet does not have enough kitchenware to serve that amount of people (I think it might have had 8 glasses and 1 coffee mug); luckily, we didn't need to cook. <br/><br/>Minus the few pros, this place is pricey and not worth the bang for the buck -- I wouldn't book here again.",2019-10,-0.9748,1693,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

It took 1 1/2 days for anyone to show up at which time he informed us the filters had not been cleaned for over a year.

The first contact told me that there must have been utility work being done in the area and asked me to go outside and walk around to see if I could locate a work truck (really??).

Let's just say the pictures advertised are not quite what you get in person.  <br/><br/>I gave this listing 2 starts because I appreciated the sheer space of the house and room to live in (with 18 woman), but we had trouble from the beginning.  Upon arrival, the front gate was broken, yard look disheveled...yard equipment, kids toys/bikes, and trash were strewn about the yard as if someone had just rushed out before we walked in.<br/><br/>We had significant issues with the lighting and electricity throughout the house.  And while the manager was quick to call an electrician, the electrician even commented that the current set-up was not suitable for a house that size, and that it was likely we would continue to have issues with the lights.  Which we did, as  I had to go in the attic to flip the breaker multiple times.  <br/><br/>Additionally, none of the TVs worked in any of the guest rooms, no towels or wash cloths in bathrooms - had to search around the house for common items.  There was mold growing in one of the dishwashers, food left in the fridge, crumbs and dirt in the kitchen and ""clean"" dishes put up in the cabinet.  <br/><br/>The pool is a whole other story.  While it was large and the water clean, it was hard to relax looking around at the disgusting mess around the pool...every chair was either cracked/broken, molded, or thrown about in the grass.  Not to mention the crumbling tile at the end of the pool with the heap of old, dirty, deflated pool rafts everywhere.<br/><br/>The unfortunate thing is that our entire group kept commenting how much potential the house had, but it just seemed so poorly taken care of.  If you are hosting an Air BnB and charging that much for a night, it should be at least clean, neat, and presentable to guests, but instead, we got dirty, disheveled and uninviting.",2022-07,-0.7315,1850,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

At first it appeared to be someone renting out their place which is always great to find, but unfortunately it was run tightly by a management company. We asked for some wiggle room with checkin and were told everything has an upcharge. Not really a great start but it's ok. We were in Austin for my little brothers wedding and just needed the place for the night. We spent 7 or 8 hours at the apartment total. In that time we discovered an unpleasent smell in the apartment (we opened all the windows to let it airout), dirty linings with dog hair and actual granuals of dirty in them, broken counter edges that were a bit too sharp to make one comfortable (glad my kids were at my in-laws), and worst of all the toilet was unsealed at the base and wiggled around with you sat on it. There was an obviously leak of sewage around the base and back of the toilet that was disgusting and quite disturbing. Now I am not saying it looked like Amber Hurd had stayed there before we did, just that there was discolored water and obvious watermarks where it has leaked previously as well as what seemed to be a very poor attempt to fix the toilet using caulk. <br/><br/>So we reached out to the host a day or two after our stay to complain about the issues and asked for a modest partial refund for the issues. They were not please and said we should have let us know earlier so they could have fixed it. I let them know I was there one night and circumstances were such that I was not able to contact them while in the apartment. They let me know in no uncertain terms that they were unwilling to give me a refund. I let them know that I would be leaving this review. I also don't think it's fair to future customers to have to stay in that kind of filth so I am working with Airbnb and with the City of Austin to make sure the issue with the toilet is addressed at the very least.",2022-11,-0.9874,1966,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

My friend checked in the first night at Jason’s Airbnb and woke up to a power outage. Multiple times she tried to contact Jason to no answer. I was unable to check in since my flight was cancelled. Instead I drove 24 hours from Las Vegas to Austin to try and meet up with my friend. I messaged Jason to please respond to my friend to which he replied that all communication must be via the messaging app. I can’t believe he said this because at that time, the state of Austin was in crisis. There was no heat, no hot water, no electricity and my poor friend was in complete distress and isolation with no updates from Jason. When I finally reached the Airbnb, it was 10 degrees (F). We asked if we could have some extra blankets, candles to which he replied that he had no additional supplies and that he could possibly drop off blankets tomorrow without any reason he couldn’t today. We lied awake at night unable to sleep in 5 degree weather completely unprepared for this disaster. In the morning, we saw that the silverware in the cabinets were dirty. We were disgusted because we used silverware the prior night but could not see due to no electricity. I can’t believe we used dirty utensils in the middle of the COVID pandemic. We decided to leave the Airbnb for safety reasons. I asked Jason if we could please leave our 2WD sedan rental car in the snowed in parking lot. It was unsafe to drive as we saw multiple car accidents due to unplowed roads and non functioning traffic lights. Jason replied that we must immediately vacate the premises at exactly 11AM when we checked out with our car gone. <br/><br/>This review would have been very different if Jason had shown an ounce of empathy, communication, and understanding for the situation. We understand that Austin was in a state of crisis and that every resident was going through hell. However, we were two people in a new city completely unprepared and unaware of the impending disaster. If Jason could have simply updated us, maybe give a reason why we couldn’t leave our car, we would have appreciated it.

Before our stay, the host sent several messages reminding us of the house rules. This set a tone that made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. We booked our stay last minute to visit some family traveling to Austin. We were unclear if the host would allow our family to come up to the room before dinner, but when we reached out to check, the host was very vague and unclear, ultimately leading us to change our plans because we were concerned they would charge us. <br/><br/>The rooms are well staged but not functional. Sheets are cheap. Pillows were uncomfortable. No extra pillows or blankets. And outlets were hidden under the rug in the bedroom, making them difficult to access. The host even told us not to take anything additional off the other beds, even though we paid for the entire condo. <br/><br/>This was also the first listing I’ve ever stayed in that didn’t have a deadbolt or interior lock, which means anyone with the keypad code could enter the condo when guests are sleeping. <br/><br/>The host’s contact number isn’t a real number that reaches anyone. It’s a voice message that directs to the app without the ability to leave a message. So in the case of an emergency, this host won’t be answering the phone. <br/><br/>All in all, I’m glad we didn’t pay the full rate for this listing due to our lack tribute booking.

There are very basic things that a guest would normally expect for a whole home rental (especially when paying very exorbitant 'holiday prices') that this place simply didn’t provide:    <br/><br/>1) Lacking the courtesy to heat the home prior to our arrival – My elderly parents (one with dementia) arrived to a very cold home and were overall pretty horrified with the initial experience.<br/><br/>2) Price gouging – I get that during a holiday period that prices will be significantly higher than normal, what I don’t appreciate are places that triple their normal rate (we paid $300+ a night, it was absolutely not worth that, nor worth half that).<br/><br/>3) Sparse and barren – This house has none of the charms and comforts that many Airbnb hosts put into their places, very little thought given by the host a guest’s comfort.  In fact, there isn’t a single flat surface in ANY of the bedrooms to place anything.  No dresser. No desk.  Nothing.  My elderly parents and myself literally had our luggage splayed out on the floor.  It was appalling.  <br/><br/>4)  Lack of essentials – With a whole home rental you expect things like dishes, pots and pans, etc. While this place had a number of these, we couldn’t find any bowls whatsoever, as well as other kitchen tools that one would expect.  Coffee maker is provided without any coffee (honestly at $300/night I’m surprised this host isn’t providing K-cups or similar!).<br/><br/>5) Poor quality of furnishings and surroundings – In addition to a lack of basic things like a dresser or desk (literally the only place in this large 4-bedroom home where one can sit and do work on a laptop is on a single dining room table),  the quality of what is there is  poor.  The dining room table chairs feel cheap and represent a bad tripping hazard.  There are literally 2 cheap and dirty plastic chairs in the garden to sit on (one with a broken lightbulb on it).   <br/><br/>6) Poor maintenance – The house overall seems a bit run down and old.  A couple bulbs were out, including a large one in one of the bathrooms.  Little thought was given to the back garden, it’s basically unusable as it is, no chairs, no ambiance, etc.  The garage feels like a construction zone, with debris and tripping hazards.  Poor maintenance when it comes to painting and structural repairs.  And the fireplace didn't work (very disappointing especially at Christmas time)<br/><br/>All in all this was by far my most disappointing Airbnb experience ever (and most expensive), and I wholeheartedly would not recommend this home or this host to anyone.

One is SO SOFT you fall to the center and sink, one is soft on top but can feel the springs under the mattress topper<br/>-- The TV lost connectivity, so wouldn't work more than a few minutes sometimes. We'd try to reconnect to WiFi but it was frustrating so we gave up and used our laptop<br/>-- The couches are not comfortable, again with the soft, sinking thing<br/>-- The kitchen lights have a wiring issue and would flicker, turn on-and-off randomly... we ended up using the hood light more than recessed lights.<br/>--  There is 1 key between 2 people and that can be challenging when there are multiple schedules<br/>-- Tools were lacking (esp for a longer stay) so we went to our house and brought back comforters, pans, pots, grill tools, etc. <br/>-- Unfortunately the heater completely broke our first night, it took 2 days to do a complete replace. The owner did jump on this right away, but we were also trying to avoid construction so this was upsetting and distracting us from work while dealing with it. <br/>-- Unfortunately the septic tank had issues in our first week so the house smelled like... septic tank. We went to our house and got smelly candles and tried to mask it but again, why are we dealing with these major issues as Airbnb renters? Just unfortunate timing.<br/><br/>Overall, the house did its job. Our infant daughter didn't seem to notice anything. Our dog could run around. We had a place to go during a remodel.

He has a lot of good reviews, so we were really shocked  at our experience. After having stayed in over 30 airbnbs this isn't new to us. The few pros are that the bed is comfortable, there is free parking, and the location is decent. The cons for us are a long list, but the biggest issue we had was that the place had not been cleaned prior to us checking-in. But the apartment was presented to us as having been cleaned. The bed had been made with the sheets of the prior guest, there was animal and human hair everywhere, food splatter all over the kitchen, a dirty toilet/tub, floors not been swept or mopped, and I could go on. The place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 4 months or more. When we alerted him of this were told that his cleaning lady had an emergency. This was after he told us that they had spent 2 days cleaning it. Basically the cleaning person did not inform Raj that the place couldn't be cleaned due to a personal issue, so the person just never informed him and we checked-in to a nightmare.  In his defense, he did try his best to make it right as much as one could at that point. But in all truth it ruined a few days our of stay and we felt completely uncomfortable the entire time we stayed there knowing how dirty the place was. The biggest issue we had is that there is no excuse that can be given for this to have happened. It is not our problem as the guest that his cleaning person had an emergency. While I have compassion for people having emergencies it is not okay to make the bed with dirty sheets or not clean a toilet seat and act like all is well.  I admit we did end up cleaning the place and getting somewhat of a discount/refund. We did this versus canceling for a full refund because at that point moving to a new location would have meant losing money due to the fact that so last minute there were no airbnbs to pick from in our budget. We felt why should be we forced to pay even more and lose money when we didn't do anything wrong. So we did have to suck it up and deal. Either way had we have moved to a new location or stayed like we did the whole experience really ruined more than a few days of our trip. Aside from the place not being cleaned, most of the furniture in the place is either falling apart, stained, or badly worn. The kitchen really lacked enough utensils to cook a meal. The TV works but is in poor condition as well. I later found out that Raj doesn't take a profit from this airbnb, and gives the money to charity, which is commendable.

However, this house is just too small to accommodate up to 20 people and with only 2 bathrooms- only one of the two bathrooms provide complete privacy, the other one has a barn-type of doors and can't be locked.<br/>There are plenty of towels, toilet papers, and paper towels available.  One thing we were surprised to find is this house has NO microwave oven.  Though this was our fault because the host never advertise that it has a microwave.  We just assume that it has because we have been at many Airbnb rentals and this is the first place that doesn't have a microwave.  We just thought that this must be an essential appliance to have.  Also during our stay the water heater broke down on the second day of our stay and the host could not repair it in time for us to take showers, which was a bummer.  The host did try very hard to resolve  the issue while we were there but was unable to because it's was a holiday weekend and it's difficult to find repairman.  However the host did compensate us $200 for the loss of use of the water heater for that evening.",2020-01,-0.1359,1311,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

Booked this house for a bachelorette party for 16 people and there was plenty of space for us to lounge, sleep and socialize. 2 bathrooms is a bit of a struggle with that many guests but not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>However, there were a few deal breakers…About an hour after check-in the entire plumbing system gave out (not our fault) and we were unable to use the toilet and shower. This was extremely inconvenient seeing as how we had just traveled all morning and had dinner reservations that night. Called and spoke with our host, Valerie and she said she’d send someone over immediately. That person showed up 1.5 hours later. After assessing the situation, he said he needed to call a plumber. We told both him and Valerie that we had dinner reservations and would be out of the house when plumber arrived (we thought someone would tell him the code or meet him there) One of our guests had a later flight and arrived at the house to find the plumber standing outside waiting to be let in. After letting him in, my guest was told she could not leave the house until he was working due to company policy (She was trying to leave the house to meet us out) we called our host, Valerie to explain the situation and see if she or someone else could go to the house to deal with the situation since we felt it was not our responsibility. Valerie ended up hanging up on us after repeatedly asking us what it was we wanted her to do??? As a host, we felt she should’ve been at the house to handle this situation or send a property manager- not make her guests handle it. <br/>End result- plumbing lines were completely clogged from past guests and had to be completely emptied. Even after the plumber fixed the problem the toilets and showers were still a bit iffy. I understand that Valerie did not cause this issue but it was extremely inconvenient to deal with on our first night. Also, upon our arrival both city garbage cans were completely full and we reached out to the host who said she would send someone over the next day to remove the garbage and no one ever showed.<br/><br/>And I know cockroaches are considered “normal” in Texas but there was a cockroach found in the main bathroom on Sunday which rubbed a lot of the guests the wrong way seeing as how we are not from Texas. Also- lots of flies in backyard near patio table even after we cleaned it upon arrival. Had to run to Walmart and buy a fly trap which caught over 30 flies in just a few hours. Pool vacuum was also very full and there were no directions on how to clean it or any directions on how to remove it. We had to swim around it all weekend and the pool became pretty dirty with leaves. <br/><br/>All in all, this Airbnb served its purpose for a large group and there was plenty of space and we all loved the initial vibe of the house but we were very turned off by the problems we encountered and the lack of communication and assistance.

The one redeeming aspect was that the location was fabulous and walkable to many shops & restaurants. The unit itself was not as advertised, was poorly constructed, and had an active dirty leak from the ceiling for the first two days of our trip. <br/><br/>Upon arriving at the unit, we noticed two things:<br/>1. The unit, which was listed as a two-king bed unit, only had one king-sized bed. <br/>2. There was an active flowing leak from the hall bathroom ceiling, which continually splashed dirty water all over the tub.  <br/><br/>I immediately contacted Sonder about both issues and was met with indifference, empty promises, and (not kidding here) gaslighting & lies from the customer service staff about both issues.  I spent the first 30 hours of our trip consistently in contact with the Sonder team, asking when I could expect the leak to be fixed, and asking why we were placed in a unit that did not have the king beds that we paid for.  The Sonder team tried to convince me that “the ceiling leaking into the tub is normal for Austin”, and “the second king bed is actually the pull-out sofa” (which was a double bed, outside of the obvious fact that a king bed listed does not mean a pull-out sofa anyway).  <br/><br/>We were never given any expected time period to expect a maintenance person to inspect our unit, so I had to just keep checking back in with the team repeatedly.  Even after someone finally showed up to fix the leak at the end of our second day (with no notice), the dirty water was never addressed from the leak, and we were simply never given an answer about the misrepresentation in the listing re: the beds. <br/><br/>I will never stay in a Sonder unit again in my life. The fact that this multi-million dollar corporation chose to gaslight and lie to its customers instead of just addressing two simple issues immediately is mind blowing. We paid a lot of money for the unit, and could’ve gotten better service in a motel. <br/><br/>Having a third party company manage a BnB dissolves the purpose of the app and makes solving issues cumbersome, instead of the advertised assurance of “better service, better experience”.

The requirements and expectations of guests, while not all unreasonable, are quite extensive and much more than any other Airbnb I’ve stayed in, so prospective guests should make sure they understand them fully.  Finally, I’m disappointed to report that interactions with the host were unexpectedly harsh after we checked out.  She took an aggressive approach to issues she had with our stay (the first ever for our family as guests), falsely accused me of being a liar regarding garbage duties, and tried to charge us $765 for damages and other frivolous items (minor, cleanable couch stains; excessive repair estimates with no basis; surprise charges for garbage; repair for an already broken table).  I volunteered to pay $75 for a little extra cleaning and trash pickup for accidentally putting out the wrong bins on garbage day.  The rest I felt was a money grab and had to write a detailed page and half to Airbnb in my defense.  Airbnb promptly decided in my favor and thanked me for “my kindness and being a great guest in the Airbnb community”.",2020-08,-0.9699,1725,3,-4.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

My stay could have been so much better if the host would’ve taken responsibility for issues that occurred instead of blaming the guest and threatening to falsely charge guests frivolously if she gets offended by guests feedback. <br/>Basically, she allowed me to book a property that was listed as newly renovated over a month prior to my 2 week visit to Austin for surgery. The day of arrival, I had an issue with the keyless lock. After waiting for hours, Shelli notified me that the neighbor had access to a key, to use that key and return it. She accused me of breaking the keypad that just went blank after trying to enter enter the code. She even suggested that we use the spare key in case there are keypad issues but the keypad should be fully charged but will reset. On my day of arrival, Shelli notified me of maintenance that the property needed that she had known about weeks before my arrival that couldn’t be completed. Shelli took offense to me stating that it would have been fair if I had been forewarned to allow me to find another place weeks ago instead of my finding out the day of arrival, the day before my major surgery. Also, if it was imperative for the work to be done, I should get some sort of discount for my inconvenience during my recovery. Shelli said that she would reschedule the work and then took the approach to continuing insisting that I take the night to find another place to stay. That was impossible since I had surgery at 6am the next morning. She even continued to message me about the lock and vacating the day of my surgery. I told Shelli that since I was in already in Austin and was recovering from surgery, the place was adorable, I will be staying. Things started to look up until a heavy rain on 5/28/21. It rained no more than 20 minutes before water started to enter the home from the garage. I contacted Shelli and she said she couldn’t call me but to send pictures. Shelli proceeded to blame me for booking the place and not allowing her to perform the maintenance on the garage. She decided to canceled the maintenance instead of proceeding with it to avoid giving me a discount. My guest and I were rudely asked to vacate the next day while I was still recovering from my surgery. We cleaned up the water and left the place how we found it and were out before the 10am check out time. I informed Shelli that we were gone and that I expected a refund for the 3 days that I had paid for. My guest and I had to finish our stay at a more expensive hotel. Shelli sent me a message hours later that the security cameras showed that the Lyft driver who picked me up accidentally ran over a strip of the grass and that is considered abuse of property. I have yet to receive my money back for the 3 days after I vacated the property.<br/>Airbnb is stating that they haven’t received a response regarding my refund either. <br/>This same property host has had the same type of poor review in which it turns into a money grab from different guests.

I encourage any potential visitors to carefully look at the other reviews and to look at the location before assuming it is a cool Austin spot.  We're not the picky types, but here were some of our discouraging experiences.  <br/><br/> - The AirBnb was notably dirty.  The rug had not been vacuumed, the shower curtain had a foot of mildew stains, the master bedroom had an odd smell, and the bed covers had dark splotches.  We could tell the owner had cleaned before we arrived, but there was a lot that was left to be desired.<br/>- The location is NOT good.  The pictures may suggest that it is in a hip area or modern construction.  It is a much older building behind a Jack in the Box and across the street from a cornerstore/bus station where people tend to loiter. <br/>-  We arrived at night and saw some of the windows in the complex were boarded up.  It is a unit that has been carefully re-purposed to look like a cool downtown condo, but it is actually an older, downtrodden complex.<br/>-  We saw nothing crime related, but the crime statistics while we were there were high and people do tend to loiter or drink in the parking lot.  If that is something that concerns you, look elsewhere.<br/>- We believe that the air conditioning was programmed so that we could not make it cooler, despite warm weather.  We ended up having difficulty sleeping due to the heat and left the windows open for much of our stay.<br/>- A representative from the City knocked on the door to drop off a notice of violation regarding the water temperature.  It did not impact us and may have been a building-wide issue, but a pretty funny representation of our stay.<br/>- The owner did not send us the door code prior to arrival.

Regardless of the past positive Reviews since that is what influenced my decision on this nightmare Airbnb. Unless you want to stay in a dirty unkempt home during the pandemic nonetheless, with dog hair and dirt all over the floor, spiderwebs above the beds, Dog urine smells where your head should rest on the bed, Un wiped tables with greasy fingerprints, dirty toilets, sinks and showers, a used pan with food in the oven, roach traps in the bedroom and even previous guests DIRTY socks in the “cleaned” beds which is just completely horrid and unacceptable. And to be frank, those bed sheets were not washed they just remade the beds with the same used linens DURING COVID and I know the host will make excuses if she responds to this because she did the same when I messaged her,  but if you’ve ever actually cleaned before you would know that there’s no way socks can be caught in between your linens once the bed is already made and plus those socks were as grimey as her floor. There’s no privacy in the kitchen and living room because there are no blinds whatsoever so forget turning the lights on at night unless you want to be completely seen from the outside. The closets that were “open” for guest use were filled with clutter up to my waist height so that was unusable as well if you’re planning a longer stay here. I felt like they were playing a joke on me I’ve never stayed in such a disorganized Airbnb. They also mentioned the garage was usable but no remote was ever found as noted in the check in procedure and the garage door was locked from the inside. This was a nightmare from the start to finish and hopefully the host takes this constructive criticism since she took all night to even message me back even though I noted in the booking process I would be checking in between 10pm-12am and she couldn’t even apologize for her dirty home just made poor excuses and offered to send her cleaner out at 8am when I was already going to be checking out in 3 hours.

First the email 24hrs prior never arrived it took several messages during the trip down there (from Sheboygan Wisconsin to Austin Texas) to get the code for entering the apartment 5hrs prior to arrival. Then finally there at 17:05, as the description when i booked was looking amazing the neighborhood was not really inviting as described, as it was getting dark some junkies came asking for money, that was clearly not what i was looking for. After 3 very slow turns around the building searching for the room - an apartment complex of about 200 rooms, by now 17:49 i contacted the owner,  but didn't get an immediate reaction, i decided to knock on someones door to show me the way after a  minute i finally found it. With the given code i tried to open it 3 times a dog started barking people started looking at me as if i was a burglar. I contacted the owner as it was officiously the wrong address, send pictures with it, and my group didn't feel safe and was tired by 17:54 i told the owner i was going to a hotel (Best Western). At 18:00pm the owner responded to me saying he was to check out what went wrong, as i found the hotel within just 3 min, i checked in, paid and on the way to my room i got an answer at 18:08 - "" I found out the problem. If you’re still there, the unit 151 is the one you can check in. Our automatic system sent the wrong email to the guest that was supposed to stay at 151""  problem solved and we could go back, i just entered my room to crush down on the bed. To tired to go back we stayed in the hotel! Then all communication with the owner stopped. No response anymore. At 18:13 i responded with another $220 for the room. No reaction. At 20:57 i responded ""My client doesn’t want to go back to the place it look better on the pictures, there where several junkies in front of the parking, my client is not used to be in a lesser neighborhood, I cancel the further stay <br/>at that place. A barking dog next door is not what I’m looking at after a 20 hour day. That we had to search for it so long and then still not getting in was to much for the day. We will stay elsewhere till Monday."" Again no response. Next day i send another mail at 06:49am ""I know the rules but it would be respectful if I would be paid back my money for a place I never got in the first place. Everything what had to go wrong went wrong and after 20 hours of traveling I just expected a good rest and that wasn’t there. As this is a business trip with my client the trust in my company got a big dent. No matter how good we are in our work this ruined the trip. For future projects I lost the trust that we can handle any job as we can not even book a good place to stay. It started on the wrong foot and will hurt my business in future deals in this area."" No response again and officiously a dum question to ask for money back. Till today 12/17/2019 back in Wisconsin no response of the owner about the place or about recuperating my money. $472 for nothing including $220 for a hotel. Another $381 for air mattresses sleeping bags and towels to stay with friends in the neighborhood and the worst first impression to a huge client for my company.

At least that was the requirement when I booked this Unit. <br/><br/>The issues I had with this place are, INSIDE the Unit - everything in it looked as if it came from a thrift store, and nothing matched. There isn’t much natural lighting in the main living area as there is only 1 window for the entire area, minus the bedrooms. The bedrooms only have 1 window each. Also, there were numerous spiderwebs throughout the house as though the house isn’t cleaned routinely. I had to change the air filter for the A/C and upon removing it, it was absolutely filthy, filthy, so filthy!  The beds and bedding are very mediocre, and the floors were very gritty. <br/><br/>The house just doesn’t have a clean feeling, and it appears as if the owner never comes to it, and here is why. <br/><br/>OUTSIDE the Unit – The grounds around the Unit aren’t kept, and there are several funky garbage cans near the walkway into the Unit. Also, near the property, there are hundreds of garbage cans that sit on the street for days/weeks; its obvious there isn’t an HOA. There are multiple Wasp and Yellow Jacket nests all over the property and near the Unit. The outside walls are covered with webs, leaves, and dead bugs.

There is a backyard connected to Unit B, but it’s not maintained, there isn’t any seating, and there is a non-functioning BBQ grill that sits near the back door.   <br/><br/>I'll end on this note, just because a person/owner/host is able to have an AirBnB doesn't mean they should, if they aren't going to reinvest back into the property.  <br/><br/>Again, BEWARE.",2022-08,-0.8469,2034,2,-61.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

I was contacted by Airbnb in August that they had removed the rental from Luxe due to consistently poor reviews and feedback. I was then contacted by Heirloom Travel, who manages this rental, promising that the concerns of past stays would be addressed before our stay in November. Heirloom noted 'wear and tear of the house' and 'poor housekeeping' as the reasons of why this rental was removed from Luxe, and that they are taking a full week of no reservations to work on the house (deep clean, new paint, etc.) before our stay. I believed the management company and rebooked with a small discount. <br/><br/>After staying in that rental, I can confirm that NONE of those promised updates were done to the house. This house is in terrible condition. 1) The photos were taken when the house was first listed, everything has seen years of wear and tear without being taken care of (the walls and floors are gray from stains). 2) Everything was dirty - Cockroaches in BOTH units - rugs, linens, couches smelled horrible. 3) Bedroom doors were off the hinges and could not even close properly for privacy and lights in many rooms and bathrooms were burned out. 4) There is construction all around this unit in the neighborhood - no sleeping in possible. 5) The patio cushions to the outdoor patio furniture were stuck in the surrounding trees? Some previous renter obviously had too much fun with those and they have yet to bother to either retrieve the cushions or replace them with new ones. 6) The wooden deck on Unit B is very obviously rotting and is a huge safety concern for large groups of people sitting outside on the balcony. <br/><br/>In short, I highly recommend not staying here and that Heirloom Travel finally considers fixing this unit before any other renter has this experience.",2021-11,-0.8921,1844,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The place looked good, accurate to the pictures and was decently clean except for the refrigerator that was full of old food condiments and had left over beer and spiked seltzers from previous guests and the coffee maker had not been cleaned and had the dirty filter and coffee still in it which was was unpleasant and made the kitchen full of fruit flies. <br/>The property is listed as being able to accommodate 10+ guests. What the host does not tell you is that they do not, nor anyone else for that matter, live there. It is obvious that the neighbors are 100% fed-up with living next to a 24/7 AirBnB. The neighbors called the cops on us multiple times for no justifiable reason. Form the moment I arrived, one of her neighbors pointed at me and shook her head disapprovingly. I was barely getting out of the car. The host specified “no parties” but did not accurately explain the situation. I don’t consider the 10 allowed guests having some drinks and listening to music at a moderate volume on a Friday or Saturday afternoon to be a “party”. If you have a problem with all 10 guests using the backyard simultaneously then <br/>that should of been specified. When the cop came on Saturday afternoon to (very politely) tell us about Friday’s complaints, he knew which gate to come into, he knew the property was an Airbnb, he had already called the host, and he told us it didn’t look like we were doing anything wrong but that these calls happened all the time with this property. In other words, we were taking the burden of previous guests’ actions. The Host tried to contact me while I was in the pool so I did not answer my phone and then showed up with her husband. Walked in to the back yard of the property and basically tried to kick us out. Acted belligerent. Told us that they had been watching us through a previously undisclosed camera which we considered to be an invasion of privacy and did not proceed to calm down until her husband started making inappropriate racial comments about how he thought we “...were obviously Mexican, aren’t you?” And about how this might be the last straw for them to loose their AirBnB host license. It is a nice property and it could have been a nice weekend but the actions of the host and her husband really put a damper on our experience and I had personally never felt so disregarded and offended. Bottom line, If the backyard amenities aren’t to be enjoyed by the amount of guests that the host states in the listing then she should lower the amount of people allowed in the house, state that more clearly, or possibly not rent out the property so often so that the neighbors don’t feel they live next to a hotel. If she and her husband have a problem with Mexicans staying at their property they should state that as well.

This is a cute duplex for a quick over nite stay, if you don't have more than 1 vehicle or have to stay longer than a day, this will work just fine.

The front door has see through glass where the owner who lives in the attached unit constantly passed by and looked in, no privacy. The parking situation was not a good one, there was only space for one vehicle on a long and narrow drive way no other place to park but the street which was not safe given the neighborhood. The toilet seat was two sizes too small for the toilet, girls sit to pee, that was a huge issue for me.  We left a day early because this was not a friendly or comfortable situation for us.   I was clear that we had fury babies,  medium size husky and a 3 month puppy.   For all pet owners, choosing an airbnb that allows pets is ALWAYS a concern, there were some paint chips by the door knob that very well could of been there but she billed me $75.00.  Pet owners beware.  If you need a place to stay near the airport with no more than 2 people and 1 vehicle this will work fine.

The gate to get into the doomed was broken 3 out of the 4 days we were there so homeless people would walk in and urinate on the stairs and on the building. The stench of urine was unbearable. We opened our door on one morning to have a homeless man literally sleeping on our doorstep. The second we would walk out of our condo homeless men would harass us for money. The dryer was broken and 2 separate people came to “fix it” and couldn’t so we couldn’t wash towels the entire stay. I feel like having the security gate working when you all know there is a ton of homeless people in the area should be a top priority. We did not feel safe.

The guests before me had animals and the place was covered in animal fur (which I’m severely allergic to) I made it about 3 hours before breaking out in hives and swelling up from all the coughing and sneezing. It was so bad the fur was getting in our mouths. My boyfriend popped open the vent to see why the air circulation sucked to see the filter CAKED in dust and pet dander. It was disgusting. It appears the place was not thoroughly cleaned if even cleaned at all. Considering the fact that there’s a pandemic and the place wasn’t properly sanitized is deeply disturbing.

I then escalated the situation with Airbnb and they tried to reach out to him twice to which he gave no response. I'm sure the place would have been lovely had I gotten a chance to stay there and didn't have to cancel my trip but the lack of empathy and cold responses from the host leading up to our stay was off putting.

It all started when I tried to check in an hour early, as I had been traveling for 10 hours. I called the number I had been given for the management company in charge of the unit and was never able to speak to a person. I left several messages on the 2 extension numbers that were provided and never received a response. I reached out via the AirBnB thread and only received a response a few hours later. This was not our only problem. The unit was falsely advertised. There was no cable, which we had specifically requested as the weather was going to be bad and one of our guests was in late pregnancy; therefore, we were going to be spending a lot of time indoors. The sofa, love seat, and chairs were all ripped and any time you sat on them, white particles hung on to your clothing. We had to place sheets over the couch and chairs so that we could sit on them without ruining our clothing. There were also cracks in the floor throughout the unit. The worst part was that the shower handle was not working and when we reached out to the management company via phone, again we received no answer. By that time, we had been traveling for over 15 hours and were in dire need of the amenities. I reached out to Ryan via the AirBnB app and asked for someone to call us directly so we could explain the situation and no one ever did. Ryan attempted to troubleshoot through the AirBnB thread, which was not helpful. There was no way to send pictures or videos through the AirBnB thread, which Ryan had asked for, so I asked for a direct number to send them, and one was never provided. Finally, after a back and forth of over 2 hours, Ryan said AirBnB would be contacting us to resolve the issue. They never did. We called AirBnB and asked for a refund as we had been trying to resolve this issue for over 3 hours without any resolution and would be leaving in the morning. AirBnB refunded us about 65% of what we paid. This is an extremely disappointing rental, I caution anyone who is looking to stay in Austin; do not stay here.

However, the host explained before the trip that they had moved the ‘aria suite’ to a different apartment number within the same building. This would have been totally fine, if the new aria suite wasn't so under stocked, and broken.  I wonder if we were the guinea pigs to stay in this new flat since the switch?  Who knows. The heater didn't work the 1st night - which is out of their control, and they fixed it as fast as possible. Which would have been great, except they entered the flat without our permission, ignoring and / or not seeing my request that we be there to let them in. From there, everything else was fairly minor, but mainly just annoying / inconsiderate. When you're paying over $2k for 4 nights, one could expect a certain mix of miscellaneous amenities that go a long way. For instance - ice trays, and dishwasher soap. There's more but cant recollect.  Ad says microwave - there's no microwave.

39928813,641427333,2020-07-23,122730290,Lisa,"Tl;dr RUN. Do not stay at this listing or any of Ryan's Austin listings. Poor communication so I couldn't check in after a long drive. Dirty and broken appliances. AC breaking and pouring water into the unit at 2 AM. Host unpleasant to deal with. Was moved to two different units Ryan owned due to broken AC and experienced a lot of the same issues in each one. For all my trouble I was refunded less than a single night's stay for a stay of nearly three weeks. DO NOT STAY AT ANY OF RYAN'S PROPERTIES!<br/><br/>Units are not in numerical order (they appear to be random order, going from the low teens to the 40s to the 30s within a few units of each other and no consistency between different floors) so I struggled to find my unit when I arrived. Tried contacting host with Airbnb message and phone call. No response. I went to get some food. No response. Three hours later and I had no assistance or help. I had to wander all over the building complex one floor at a time with people staring at me to find my unit. After that, the parking information was inaccurate. I was told to park in a specific spot in my welcome instructions (G2 I believe?) But there was no G2. I contacted the host again and waited. No response until I found what appeared to be a private number and called that. Host tried to tell me to call back later! I told him that was unacceptable and finally got help. Host claimed that the HOA had repainted the parking lines without telling them and to just park in ""Onyx Hotels Guest"". A completely stressful and miserable experience checking in. I should have known my entire stay was going to be a big issue here but I was so tired from my drive that I reasoned the hard part was done and the rest would be okay. (It was not.)<br/><br/>When I entered I noticed a foul smell. I tracked it to the washing machine and found it absolutely full of black mold. There was no bleach in the unit to just run a cleaning cycle. The host told me I'd have to just go buy my own and scrub out the machine myself. <br/><br/>I also noticed the AC was making a weird noise (located in the ceiling above the closet). I told them I was concerned the condensate was not draining appropriately. I got no response to this. <br/><br/>The unit was missing small things I'd expect in an Airbnb. No hand soap in kitchen. No rinse aid for dish washer. Non stick pans were all scratched up (which is dangerous). There were no cleaning supplies to wipe up spills which I'd think would be especially nice to provide during a respiratory pandemic. I was told if I wanted any cleaning supplies I'd have to buy them myself. There was also no washing machine detergent which I had to buy myself again. <br/><br/>Several days into my stay, I was awoken at 2 AM to water pouring through my ceiling from the AC unit (after they had ignored my request to have someone check it out). I put down towels and pots to catch the water and turned the AC off. I tried the phone number and the message system but there was no response. So I texted Ryan's personal number. I do not recommend this. He was unpleasant when we exchanged texts, telling me how he had ""over 150 units"" and he's still there 24/7 for his guests and that he was ""sorry you're so upset"". Never once made an actual apology for how abysmal my experience was, left that up to his property manager.<br/><br/>AC tech got sent out the next day. They did what they thought was a temporary fix. But within a few hours water was pouring from the ceiling again. This would result in me being moved to a different unit of Ryan's in the same complex. This unit, as it turns out, also had broken AC (which I found out after I'd already scrubbed the mold in this washing machine with bleach I'd been forced to purchase and discovered the dish washer was broken). So I was moved to a third unit in the same complex. The AC worked fine here throughout the rest of my stay. However, the garbage disposal broke, the dish washer broke (had to wash all my dishes by hand), I couldn't get hot water to the master bathroom shower (even though a repair person came out multiple times, I just gave up and used a different shower with hot water), and the kitchen was gross (dirty cups with lip stains and dried drinks at the bottom, a spoon with rancid butter on it shoved in a drawer, spiders spilling out of the knife block when I pulled a knife out). <br/><br/>What did I get to compensate such a bad time over the course of three weeks? I was refunded less than a single night's stay. <br/><br/>As I found out, Ryan (the host) is not the one you're speaking with over the Airbnb account even though it says you're speaking with Ryan. To speak to Ryan, you need to use his personal cell number. Ryan will get irritated if you suggest he let guests know they aren't speaking to Ryan over the Airbnb messages that say you're speaking to Ryan. But so much was lost in communication using texts and Airbnb messages because I was talking to two different people and never knew. Once I had a direct line to the property manager for all future problems (and there were many) communication was prompt and polite. <br/><br/>The only nice thing of my stay was the location and the support staff. The staff was always timely and polite. It's clear to me that they're understaffed and overworked. <br/><br/>Miserable experience.

First it all began Friday morning. We were told at the end of September that we could check in early on Friday or even the night before which I thought was wonderful. My sister drove 3 hours to only arrive to the place and have the code not work. I message the owner and he replied with another working code. Once she walked in she noticed someone was SLEEPING IN THE HOUSE! It was totally unsafe for her to do this not know what she was walking into. I immediately called him and he had no idea why someone was there and I was never informed either. This already ticked me off considering she needed to get in their and decorate plus the situation was unsafe. His communication through this was shit. I would send multiple texts to his phone and I would get a 3-5 worded response an hour later. After a response was given and he talked to I guess his ‘property manager’ he said that the person sleeping there would be out by 11 and maids would come then. I didn’t think this was fair at all considering we booked this place and they get the joy of just sleeping in while she waiting in her car. The maids didn’t arrive till 11:45 and did a terrible job cleaning. The maids told my sister she would have to put the bedding in the dryer and back on the beds if needed and just left. We were also suppost to be given parking passes for the garage which were no where to be found on the counter. When I texted him about this issue it took an hour to respond and all I got was ‘I suspended towing’. Okay didn’t know you could do that but at this point I was over it. The weekend went on and when i arrived Friday evening the pictures on Airbnb and what is in person do not match. The whole house looks terrible things are broken, the couch was totally different, no rugs, no bathroom towels at all, barley any toilet paper, no trash bags .. I could go on and on it basically wasn’t anywhere near ready for people to stay for the price we paid for this weekend. Come Sunday morning for check out we did what we needed to do than came down to the parking garage and realize my friends care was TOWED!! She was pissed and thank goodness her car has a tracker because we were never notified by ANYONE where her car was even taken or when. We would of had no way to find it. I ended up texting him this and all he replied was ‘I can Venmo her $100’ like we don’t want your money we want this shitty place to be fixed or a refund. She thankfully didn’t have to pay the towing fee because I had the text messages between the owner and I stating he suspended towing but the situation still happened when I didn’t need to.

I reached out to the host and I was told ""just give it time to warm up."" I then explained it had been on for 30 minutes. I sent pictures of the temperature dropping from 64 to 59 in the house. After a frustrating back and forth via the messenger app (no one called me) which basically involved the host assuming I was just using the thermostat wrong  I was then told to call the number on the thermostat to trouble shoot it, which of course was a business line and it was after hours so I just got a voicemail. Someone finally called me around 9pm (not the person I had been communicating with) to say they were sending someone out by 11pm to look at it. I told them that I wasn't comfortable being there alone with a repair person that late at night and asked if one of them was coming to meet them. Nobody involved in the property was planning to be there, so I told them they could either send someone the next day or one of them could come that night to meet the repair person. They didn't want to come that night so they asked when would work the next day. I told them I was working from the airbnb and I needed quiet and privacy and would be done by 1:30pm so they could come in the afternoon. I tried to just turn the system off and it wouldn't turn off and I couldn't find a breaker box, so the a/c ran all night.  By the time I finally got to bed on that night after trying myself to fix and trouble shoot the heater, when I opened the bed, there was hair in the sheets.  I took pictures but was so frustrated with everything else and it was so late I just didn't even mention it to them. I assume someone slept there and the sheets didn't get changed. The next morning, even though I had explained that I needed to work from the airbnb in the morning I was told that someone would be coming at 9am which was when I needed to be getting ready for work. I had to insist that someone managing the property come and meet that person so I could get ready for my day instead of managing repairs. They sent someone over thank goodness. Turns out the thermostat was broken. The person who came on Saturday was very nice and apologetic and offered to change the lightbulbs later that day, but by that point I was so frustrated, I just wanted to get out of the place. All in all, staying at this airbnb was entirely too much coordinating with people who were not communicating with each other and have unrealistic expectations that their airbnb guests should be troubleshooting the issues in their property. Someone involved in managing the property should have offered to come look at the thermostat and make a plan when it wasn't working that night.  I liked the space, but would not stay there again, as it doesn't seem they are proactive about making sure the space is ready for guests or that the guest has a positive experience in the property.",2022-10,-0.4281,3562,12,154.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

Just blocks from so many restaurants, walking paths, and 6th Street. The space was quaint. The back patio was nice to have when we wanted to sit outside. The washer, dryer, fridge, dishwasher, and stove were very convenient. <br/><br/>Now the cons... I’ve never stayed in an Airbnb that was so dirty and scarce on basic things. The first thing I noticed was that there was no doormat, and we were constantly tracking in dirt from how sandy it was outside. Then there were dead bugs everywhere. We had to sweep immediately upon arrival and had to continue sweeping up dead bugs. <br/><br/>There is also Packing tape around the doors, maybe as a way to keep bugs out or the AC in. Then we noticed the flooring in the kitchen was coming up by just walking on it. <br/><br/>There is not adequate parking and though we were told we could park in the alley, neighbors who also use the alley would honk at us as they passed. There is one window unit and it is not adequate for cooling the whole place. We understand heat, we are from south Mississippi. So this isn’t a review from someone who just doesn’t know how to deal with heat. The kitchen would be so hot that we could not really enjoy cooking, or even just having a meal when we got take out. <br/><br/>The bed was comfy, but the pillows were all yellowed with stains. The bathroom floor needed cleaning. Roach poo on the sink was not so appealing. <br/><br/>There is a pull out sofa as the listing indicates, but it’s in the bedroom and if it was folded out, it blocks the bathroom. Not ideal. <br/><br/>We have stayed on lots of Airbnb’s and this is the dirtiest one we have ever been to.

Often times, vacation implies relaxation and letting your guard down from the throws of daily stress, to the detriment of your mental agility. During our stay here, we didn't have to worry about our minds getting rusty when it came down to crunch time decisions, such if you should roll the dice (who says you can't gamble in Austin?) with ambiguous parking suggestions or pay $34 dollars to park overnight at the Hyatt to remove any doubt of towing. For us, the answer was clear. What's $136 dollars to leave your car in a space for 4 nights, when you really think about it. Or if you just kind of think about it, which is the modus operandi we followed and recommend to find a semblance of tranquility while staying here. As we approached the building we saw the beautifully decorated lobby. We got a very very good look from the outside because the code to the lobby didn't work the entire time we were there. We aired this grievance to The Sonder, but ""no one else had a problem so it should work."" It's fine, it finally gave us an opportunity to yell HOLD THE DOOR to the elite guests who were granted access. Once inside the unit, you can walk towards the large window and take in the views of surrounding buildings you could've stayed at. As you're overlooking and absorbing the echoes of the volleyball court below, you'll feel a slight breeze. As if the living room invites nature in for tea, or because the backdoor isn't capable of closing. The back door does not close. The good news is, once the grievance was aired, there was a resolution within 48 hours. Instructions were provided on how to close a door. They didn't work, but you'd be remiss to not appreciate instructions on how to close a patio door.<br/>I'd also like to comment on the name Sonder. you're realizing everyone has a life as complicated as your own, more so if they decided to book through the same avenue and invite worry with regards to a gate code, parking space and back door insulation.",2020-07,-0.361,2033,5,-64.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

It says it can sleep up to 12 but that is only if you bunk up multiple people and have someone sleep on the floor. It actually only has 6 beds and 2 of those are kings. If you have 2 people sleep in each king that still leaves a gap of 4 people to sleep on the floor or in the living room. Very misleading from a guest count number. Last negative was the amount of homeless population around the place in all directions. Going for a morning walk is a little uncomfortable because you need to keep your guard up. We actually had the YMCA right next to the place get broken into and the front glass door was shattered in the morning. However one positive is how close it is to Rainey street.

We did receive a tour from Frank on how to use the technology which is a bit complicated to use so we appreciated the instruction. <br/><br/>The rooftop deck is incredible and we really enjoyed it. The bed is also one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on for an AirBnb.  <br/><br/>While we enjoyed our stay overall, we were disappointed with the AirBnb and would probably not book again at this price tag. Over $500 a night is expensive for a 1 bedroom and we expected the AirBnb to reflect that price. Instead, several features of the home weren't working properly. The hot tub is high tech, but only 2/8 of the jets are working. This was deeply disappointing as the hot tub was one of the main draws. The shower is fantastic, but you can only use half of it to avoid leaking into the bottom floor. Although not a big deal, the dryer was also broken. We weren't planning on using that anyways but it's emblematic of a lack of maintenance at the house. Frank was aware of all these issues, as he told them to us when he gave the tour, but has not rectified them. (On the dryer, he said it had been broken the previous weekend and he was waiting for parts). <br/><br/>We also notified Frank that the shower had no shampoo, conditioner, or soap. He said the previous guests had probably stolen them and offered to replace them. I personally expect hosts to inspect the home after each stay to see if things are missing before the next  guests arrive. Frank did offer to replace these items, which we appreciated. He gave us 3-in-1 that day, which as a woman I really can't use on my hair. 2 days later he gave us shampoo and soap (but not conditioner).",2020-11,-0.8838,1786,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

This was true for the toaster and the microwave oven as well. <br/>We work paycheck to paycheck, and if we were richer, we surely would have left within 15 minutes of arriving.  Easy as heck fixes here – first, get a safer lock system. A new sliding glass door would be fabulous with an updated, effective lock on it (since it’s the main entrance) to me is a no-brainer in a city with crime. The sliding glass door that is currently installed is from the day the apt complex was built which is many decades ago. Get rid of the dead plant, the dead flowers, clean the doggone floors, tighten up the outlets and get some air freshener plug-ins at the very least.

Adding insult to injury, we were expected to carry our trash and recycling to the bins out behind the building. Speaking of spaces, the parking spaces are narrow.

It does not look like that in reality!!!  The decorations are sad for any comparable rentals in the Hill Country.  They have added a couch and chair with ottoman in the living area which is nice.  There are no dish towels or dish rags in the kitchen only a sad little scrubber sponge to try and clean the counter tops with.  The linens and pillows on all the beds should be thrown away immediately because they are horrible.  My grown daughter slept in the top bunkbed one night, and bugs were crawling on her.  All of the towels are sad and should also be thrown out for a rental like this.  We were given 6 towels for a rental that listed 7 guests.  We found 2 towels in what we thought might be our laundry room off of our patio.  Soon, we realized that housekeeping was doing the property's laundry in our cabin which was probably why we never had any hot water.  The floors were not clean.  They were maybe only spot cleaned.  The shower door had slimy black stuff on the bottom corner of it.  There is a nasty, dirty curtain over the bathtub.  The curtains over the dining room table and sofa are torn and dirty.  The fence was falling down in the back yard.  The living room door and window let in so much wind that it was impossible to keep the cabin warm.  We were expecting a much nicer property when we rented the biggest cabin on the property for our daughter's wedding at the Brewery.  Also, expected some signage to be able to know not to turn into the Brewery to find the cabins!  There's no signage.  After our daughter got married at the Brewery, a hot water pipe busted in the outdoor shower due to cold weather.   I also appreciated them sending an engineer over so quickly when the pipe broke.  Having the water shut off to our cabins was such a bad ordeal.  There was no water in the Bunting Cabin where my mom was and was too tiny for us to go over there anyways.  The Coyote Cabin was full of other wedding guests.   I felt like we were literally left out in the cold with the 7 guests in our cabin that night without water, one of those being our 2-year-old grandson.  I have MS and walk with a cane and/or walker so the outdoor bathrooms in the middle of the night in freezing weather were not an option but was suggested to us by mgmt.  The closest hotel only had 2 rooms at $149 per night plus taxes which is not nearly enough for 7 guests plus a dog.  We were tired, angry, and cold.  We all ended up driving 3 to 4 hours home that night because of the whole fiasco!  We had a terrible time trying to pack up after having a day of wedding stuff coming back to the cabin was what we were looking forward to in order to relax.  We were told we would be refunded for the cabin for one night plus the cost of hotel rooms but were only refunded $500.  That was not fair.  We were left ""out in the cold"".  I am extremely unhappy with that aspect of the service.  I understand it was no one's fault the freezing weather broke a pipe in the outdoor shower, but it is someone's fault that we were told we were going to be provided hotel rooms and were not.  After all the money I spent at Jester King that weekend, I expected better treatment.  I can't get over the conversation we had not matching what was given to me.  As I told them during our phone conversation that night, I wasn't looking for a hand-out, I was just looking for somewhere for my family to stay.  We were tired, cold, and frustrated.  We needed a place to stay.  Seven people cannot stay in a cabin without water or in one hotel room!  We stay in rentals in Texas with our large family, but this was by far the worst for the money.  The cleanliness, the quality of linens, decor, furniture, and lack of care that we were without a place to go after our wedding is, at least to me, in poor taste.

We were house hunting and airbnb'ing in the meantime. <br/><br/>The first thing that we noticed was that the AC wasn't working properly. We notified Airbnb and Ivette. It took 2 separate occasions for a technician to come and fix it. This was very concerning to us because Austin gets incredibly hot in the summer and is in the middle of a heat wave where if the AC isn't working it becomes unlivable. After being ""fixed"" by the technician who confirmed that cold air was indeed blowing into the house, the temperature in the upstairs would not go below 77/78 degrees F during the day.  So for those who can't tolerate the heat, this would not be a good place to stay. <br/><br/>During the communication with Ivette in regards to the AC Airbnb requested that a refund for the days that we didn't have AC working, be given. When that exchange happened, Ivette continued to ask me how I'm going to compensate her for bringing my service dog. Now it's important to note that before staying at her place I had informed her that I have a service dog and she said that it was okay.  But when negotiations were happening asking for a refund she repeatedly asked me how I was going to compensate her for bringing my dog. I responded each and every time that my dog is a service animal but she seemed to gloss over it. It finally reached a point where I asked her, is there a reason why you keep asking me??  Because at that point it feels like discrimination.  I then told Airbnb that my host is not being understanding of the fact that I have a service animal even though I mentioned it to her prior to staying at her place.<br/><br/>Now this is where it gets even worse, the fire alarm was blaring for 3 days straight during our stay. It was the blare that you get when the fire alarm is running out of batteries. The fire alarm is situated on high vaulted ceilings that you would need a ladder to access. It was a beep every few minutes the whole night. It was absolute torture. The second day the security system kept beeping. The third day the fire alarm would beep/blare. It was a nightmare and psychological, mental, and emotional torture because the beeps were so loud that it disturbs your overall being. And I would liken the beeping to Chinese water torture except, perhaps worse, because on some days you didn't know when it would malfunction. Turns out the fire alarm was out of batteries like we told Ivette. And the security system was going off because it was connected to the fire alarm.  When she did get assistance to help us with the fire alarm it would take hours because her house manager lives an hour away in Round Rock. And when she had people show up, she didn't notify us. There was once a lawn mower maintenance guy who showed up in the backyard when the glass door to the backyard is completely transparent which is an invasion of privacy.<br/><br/>The helpfulness and communication with Ivette was awful. It felt like she blamed us for the problems rather than trying to work with us to solve them.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say the listing itself was fine. The location was great.

However there are an excessive amount of fees that come with just about any problem for the house that included even a $50 fee just to send something you forgot, and a $100 fee for broken objects, or unauthorized people and more. It just felt like there were more rules and I could never enjoy my time at the condo cause everything was going to cost me money if I messed something up. Finally there is a $90 cleaning fee but they require you to remove the linen and take out the trash and sweep and make sure the house is as clean as when you left it, even though you’re forced to pay $90.

The neighborhood looked unsafe on the way in. The sliding glass door was left unlocked upon arrival. There were three bath towels, one hand towel, and one wash cloth for two adults staying a total of four nights. The towels were very hard and scratchy. There were no dish towels in the kitchen to dry your hands on. The couch and ceiling fans in the unit were completely different than the ones in the listing photos. The living room ceiling fan did not work at all and there was exposed wiring. I went to bed in the bedroom on the final night and woke up early to the ceiling fan being off and the ceiling fan light turned on when I went to bed with the fan on and the light off. The unit didn't appear very clean, there was noticeable dirt and hair on the bathroom tile including a long single red hair stuck to the shower wall. The hand soap dispensers are filled with dish soap which didn't pump properly which leaked onto the counters in globs. The shower curtain rod and hooks were rusted, there was an odd exposed pipe coming out of the ceiling above the shower, and the utility flap in the bathroom ceiling appeared to be rusted and have slight water damage. I tried to run a towel load before departure but couldn't get the machine to work. There was weather stripping hanging down from the front doorway. The flooring was bubbling and coming up (stick on laminate). The bed in the bedroom was advertised as a king but it was more like a queen. I'm upset that this unit was not accurately described and failed to meet my expectations. The pictures were very deceiving, the couch was completely different, other decor items.

I agreed to this and understood that if a hot water heater fails, there’s not much you can do about that except wait. You’ll notice that a recent review before mine mentions the hot water issue as well.<br/>2) on my first morning, I kept noticing this mildew type smell, and I woke up this strong headache. I almost never get a headache, so this was odd. I eventually found the smell was coming from the AC unit in the wall. I pulled off the lid to find that the entire unit was covered in black mold. This was especially dangerous because the unit fan is over the bed frame, so you’re directly under the fan, and, there is no circulation in this enclosed, less than 300 square foot space. I arrived on an 85 degree hot Texas day, so that unit runs constantly. I don’t have to explain why breathing in black mold is dangerous, but I was pretty shocked to see this level of negligence.<br/><br/>I ended up contacting AirBNB directly, knowing that between the hot water issue+mold issue, I had no plans to stay in this space. I requested AirBNB to cancel my stay, and issue a refund, which they did.<br/><br/>There are, however, some positives:<br/>1) the hosts communicate fast! That’s really nice.<br/>2) the location is awesome. Less than a block or so away from everything. This was my primary reason for booking this location.<br/>3) it’s a great space for one, maybe two people.

Not because of the people I was with (my best friends) but because of my host's inability and unwillingness to help on multiple problems as well as his inability to provide a safe space to stay in. I will explain chronologically. When I showed up to the house we walked through the home’s front gate which was easily opened but lacked the piece needed to keep the gate closed (we found it on the floor and had to rig it to close) to avoid leaving the gate wide open inviting everyone on the street to come on in. This was minorly concerning until we got to the door. Me, my wife, and our friends, (3 other couples') stood in the frigid Texas cold which was the start of a cold front moving in for the weekend trying to find the check-in instructions. After finding them, they read ""door code ####"" which puzzled us when we looked up because there was no combination lock on the door, just a key hole. after spending about 15 minutes trying to find an unlockable gate or door of some sort, we got a message back from our host saying ""Under the mat."" It was not under the mat. My friend, fed up with the cold, twisted the knob and pushed and BOOM the door was open! My 7 friends and I stood in the empty door looking into the dark room afraid to go in because anyone could have easily walked on in ahead of us. After checking all the cabinets and closets we assumed no one was in the house. With his short responses we knew he wouldn't be much help so we continued to look for keys to lock the door. after looking in every possible place, under every possible matt, we could never find the keys to the house. Because we were all hungry, we decided to go out but soon remembered the fact that we had no keys to lock the house. Long story short we knew that we would either have to leave someone home to guard our stuff, pack our stuff into the cars every time we leave, or take our chances. We took our chances. when one couple entered their bedroom, they complained that their door could not close all the way. They weren't too offended by the idea except for the fact that the whole house was freezing and their room was the only one with heat. They ended up sacrificing their heat and privacy and left the door open. Throughout the trip we struggled to keep the heat in the house above 65 degrees which was a worsening issue as the outside temperature continued to drop below 20 degrees. When we woke up the first morning the temperature inside the house was 60 degrees and dropping after we told our host about this we asked for instructions on how to fix the heating situation. His reply was short, apathetic, and not sweet, ""still not heating up?"" to which I replied ""62"" ""62"" he replied ""OK on the nest set it to 75 and shoot me a picture I called an HVAC guy but I'm afraid it’s impossible they aren't available and too busy because of the road conditions."" We told him we would trouble shoot. We did and nothing worked. We thought it was suspicious that he asked to send a picture of the thermostat at 75 because it looked almost like the house was 75 so we took pictures of the actual temperatures which during the trip dropped to 51 degrees inside of the house. It was almost better outside in the sunlight than in the house. We also tried our hand at contacting HVAC which SUPRISINGLY offered to come out and help. Because I wasn't about to pay for our bad hosts heater, I declined but noted the fact that he must not have tried too hard to get an HVAC guy out. Not great. Because it was so cold, we continued to go out into town in search of heat which we somewhat found but all the while, ran the risk of all of our stuff getting stolen because we couldn't lock the door. That night, two of the couple's had experienced enough and decided to go to a hotel. One payed 140$ the other payed 150$ both in fear that they would wake up to a frozen significant other next to them if they stayed. Since I payed, I gave them their money back for the night. In the morning on the last day of the trip, I messaged our uninterested host. ""Hey Andy the heat never got above 64 last night and began to fall to 60 later on and was 51 this morning. the first night in the low 60's was tough but bad enough for half our guests who have to get hotels. Not sure what your refund policy is for stuff like this and its obvious it wasn't purposeful but I would urge you to refund some of the money especially with it getting to 51 and lower last night..."" for days I never got a reply or a refund. I tried to wait and give him a chance before writing a review. Then finally I was messaged by him through Air BnB! It was a Damage claim saying that WE broke the door which wouldn't close! Half laughing at this ridiculous notion, I declined the damage request and am now writing this review.

They sent a maintenance guy out to drop off some spray and we took care of it, crisis diverted.  The downstairs living space was dirty at checkin, it could've used a sweeping or mopping and a vacuum on the rugs.  There  were water bottles left under the couch and the microwave was filthy.  They sent housekeeping out the next day when we were out of the house and upon returning, there was no noticeable difference in the spaces we complained about.  The trash cans were full and they reeked of seafood/shrimp and it stunk up the whole property at checkin.  You could literally smell the trash from the entry door of the property we stayed at, which is probably 50-60ft from each other.  The maintenance guys we’re supposed to dump the trash cans out when we made a complaint but they failed to do that.  I feel bad for the people that checked in behind us, there was trash overflowing and it’s a real eyesore at checkin.

42854184,405026028449662114,2021-07-12,392301483,Kyle,I arrived to one of the most uncomfortable Airbnb’s I have ever stayed in. There were 3 rooms and I didn’t know which one I had to sleep in so I picked one. The next evening the host came in the room at 2 am drunk and told me I wasn’t supposed to stay in that room and that I was supposed to be in another. I stated there was no information or signage to which room I should stay in. <br/><br/>The shower did not work.  The bathtub faucet spewed out most of the water and only a trickle came out of the shower head. The host blamed other guests for it being broken but it was never fixed during my stay. <br/><br/>There is a cat that stays there that was licking its butt the majority of the time in the hallway. I could hear it through my door when I was trying to sleep. <br/><br/>Ps don’t forget there are no blankets on the beds and no towels in the bathroom. If traveling you must provide your own!!! <br/><br/>There is a tiny kitchenette. I assume the new six pack of East’s ciders was a welcome gift to guests as most  Airbnb’s provide for there was nothing at all welcoming about this Airbnb.  You have to text the host to get the AC turned down which is extremely annoying because it was always just hot. No wonder there is a box fan next to the bed and no blankets. <br/><br/>Upon leaving I received a notice that the host is charging me $240!!!!  $180 for accidentally sleeping in a room I wasn’t supposed to!!! I had no idea which room was mine!  $10 for the beer?  There’s nothing stating that this was a mini bar and that they charge for it.

I had rented this unit for 5 weeks due to the holidays and my daughter having a new baby, and spent a lot of money, expecting to have what was listed in the Airbnb listing.  When I arrived to the property the apartment was disgustingly dirty!  I had to clean myself, and when I mopped the floor I realized how dirty because the floor was filthy.  The listing was advertised to have two king sized beds (which has been changed on the listing now because I complained, I have a screenshot of the original listing).  When going through the kitchen I saw there was only 3 forks, 4 spoons, and 1 knife in the drawer.  How is anyone expected to eat with the ""complete kitchen"" that was advertised.  Also in the kitchen, a 5 pot coffee maker.  If you have 6 people there, (as advertised you can sleep), you constantly have to make coffee.  There were no instructions on how to use the TV; most Airbnb's we have rented always have instructions. There were no dressers to put your clothes in and we had to put everything on the shelves in the closet, which by the way, did not contain any robes that are shown in the pictures and was also dirty.  When I further cleaned the next day I saw that the sliding glass door was open and the lock was broken.  We slept the first night with an unlocked door!!! This was completely unsafe and dangerous!!! I sent the ""hosts"" three different messages on three different days to fix the lock to which I got the response ""we will let our maintenance people know.""  They never showed to fix the problem.  The ""patio"" was disgusting and dirty and not what was shown in the pictures.  Upon further observation, I found mold in the shower, the walls were dirty and also contained mold, the ""pullout couch"" was not a pullout, just slept one person.  The molding around the floor was dirty and broken.  The vertical blinds at the sliding glass door had 6 panels.  When I tried to use the dishwasher, it did not work, only to get a response from the host ""we will let maintenance know.""  But the final straw was when I was using the kitchen sink I started to feel my feet getting wet and looked down and in the cabinet and there was water filling the cabinet.  I messaged the host and got the same response, ""we will let maintenance know."" That is when I called Airbnb directly and sent them pictures.  The Airbnb representative was incredible and so helpful with our problem!  I can't thank them enough. I have pictures and videos of everything. This was a horrible experience and this host should not be able to list  properties on Airbnb.  After calling Airbnb and them investigating, I received a full refund within 15 minutes, which tells me this is not the first time they have dealt with this property.  As soon as this happened we were out the door within the hour.  I am also convinced that the comments listed under the listing are completely made up.  I can't believe this host would advertise what what they do and get away with it.  I have documented everything, and I would NEVER rent anything that this host is associated with!!!!! This host ruined what was suppose to be a wonderful holiday week!!!  Also, according to the amenities listed on the listing page, these are the things that are NOT true according to the listing.

This was the worst experience I have ever had booking a vacation rental. They do not run their business with integrity. They want your money and they don’t care that they do not provide what they advertise. We gave Turnkey the opportunity to make this right and they did not. We booked this until based on the pictures and description and after speaking to their representative. Turnkey did not disclose that the unit’s driveway and the property surrounding it were under construction which caused us to not be able to enter the property. The driveway was 2 thin strips of concrete with deep trenches on either side. The road leading up to the property was also under construction. I describe it as gravel mogul pits. The parking space for the unit was already taken by the homeowner of the other unit. The other homeowner advised us to park in a business across the street. We decided we didn’t want to risk being towed for parking on someone else’s property. We called Turnkey and asked for assistance and said we were willing to accept another property. Turnkey did not provide us with any assistance. We did not check in to the unit at all as the driveway and perimeter was not safe to drive on and should we have driven on it, we would have had to back out of the long driveway on raised concrete strips risking going in a trench if we made a mistake. It was dark when we checked in. We had to go to a hotel for the night. We had to cut short our trip and drive home early. I cannot believe Turnkey was so greedy for our payment they would risk putting a family with a child and a dog in a hazardous property without disclosing the information. If it had been an oversight on their part, we gave them ample opportunity to make this right. They chose not to. They did not refund any of our rental fees, pet fees, cleaning fees, etc and we did not check-in or enter the property. This company is greedy and does not conduct business with honesty or integrity. After calling the company several times, I finally received an email from Margaret in their corporate office that I should have purchased travel insurance. I’m quoting her email “We are not moving forward with any refund amounts at this time. In accordance with our cancellation policy as shown below, no refund will be issued for any non-refundable payments or Weather and Other Unforeseen Events: TurnKey does not accept liability for any inconveniences, delays, or your inability to booking in a Unit arising from any temporary or permanent defects or stoppage in supply of water, gas, electricity, or plumbing, damage caused by weather, road closures, or conditions, construction, natural disasters, disruption or cancellation of your travel, events, conferences or reason for your booking, government orders, pandemics, viruses, illnesses, infestations, water conditions, closings, pollution, acts of God or other reasons beyond TurnKey's control. No refunds will be given for any delays or cancellations due to such conditions. Accordingly, travel insurance with “cancel for any reason” terms is highly recommended for all bookings and may purchase online at https://turnkeyvr.com/insurance.<br/>We are sorry for any frustrations and we understand this is not the solution you were looking for, but hope you understand our position at this time. Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with.”<br/><br/>Dear Margaret,<br/>This booking was not eligible for the cancel for any reason travel insurance.

There is also a boat ramp on the property to use so you don’t have to go to a public boat ramp. However the bot ramp is not very safe and has broken rock on the sides and has uneven concrete that is old and broken in some areas so just be careful. <br/><br/>The worst part was how unsafe the chairs and seating areas are. One of the chairs broke while my mom (on her 60th bday weekend) was sitting in it by the pool broke and she hit her head on the fence and almost hit it on a rock that she barely missed. There was no concession offered or anything offered from the owner except for an apology. That is unacceptable and I honestly think should have resulted in a full refund since it could have been a law suit. <br/><br/>Also the houses were all dirty with bugs and leaves. The ground keepers were actually blowing leaves into the bedroom under the door when we arrived for check in and we had to sweep them out ourselves! There were gaps under all the doors so every morning you had dozens of rolly pollys and spiders all over the floor you have to clean up. Also be aware the photos have not been updated online and it will look different and not in a good way from what you see in the photos. It’s not terrible but looks way nicer in the photos. <br/><br/>Overall we still had a good time, but for over $1200/day for the stay was way over priced for what you get and very disappointed the owner did nothing to offer a refund or even come out to fix and check the equipment after the chair broke and hurt my mom bad.

I suspect this was the same message sent to other guests which may explain all the 5 star reviews for this listing. I think because of that I was mislead when booking. I was expecting a 5 star stay but this listing was 3 stars at best.  I’m leaving an honest review so others don’t get mislead. <br/><br/>Cleanliness - Upon check-in we had to strip the sheets off the bed because they were dirty. We picked up a couple big clumps of hair.  There was mold in the shower caulking. The windowsills were loaded with dead bugs. When I opened a window the wind blew a dead spider onto me. Nasty!  At check out the host wanted me to tell her when we were leaving because the cleaners were on a tight schedule. I have to imagine the cleaners were rushed before we checked in. <br/><br/>Comfort - There is an old couch but really not enough space to comfortably sit more than 2 people. Footrests or a coffee table would go a long way for relaxation. There was a big backyard but no furniture to relax outside. <br/><br/>Wifi - the wifi was brutal. When there’s more than 1 device connected the wifi is laggy and very spotty. My partner and I were working remotely during our long term stay and had a lot of issues. More than a few times I had calls drop which is a bad look for me with my clients.  Online gaming was impossible with the lag. The listing advertised high speed wifi but that’s just not the case when more than 1 device is connected.<br/><br/>There were so many things that just didn’t work. The cold water in the bedroom sink did not work (hot water was fine), the overhead stove light was broken, the dishwasher did not dry the dishes (and there was no drying rack for dishes so you have to hand dry everything), the bedroom window just barely doesn’t close which made it unnecessarily loud at night. The list goes on.  <br/><br/>Overall this listing is just average at best so I’m giving it 3/5 stars. The only features above average were the TV (large smart tv), the large kitchen sink w/ garbage disposal, and location which includes two food trucks and a convenience store just steps away.  Every other feature was average or far below average.  It seems that not a lot of effort went into this place.<br/><br/>This listing is probably okay if you just need a place to sleep for a weekend but would not recommend for long term stays especially if you’re planning to work remotely.",2022-04,-0.7383,2498,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

While I’m grateful to have a roof over my head, for the price I paid for one night, I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the building, unit, and stay. By the way the unit was marketed, my expectations were very high, anticipating a more luxurious stay at a “professionally designed, sparkling clean” apartment unit.  Upon arriving, the apartment building was under construction, which caught me off guard as there was no prior warning. The work being done on the building obstructed the parking details I was instructed to followed which again, was unexpected and frustrating. Lastly, I was surprised, and again frustrated, by the list of check out instructions that included taking out the trash, removing the sheets, and running the dishwasher while I paid a $65 cleaning fee in my total cost.

The grass was super tall - trash in the backyard - and so many bugs could not really be out there.   As soon as you open the door the house smells like dog.

And then to top it all off - the host had the audacity to try to charge us a fee for dog crap?! -  We had no dogs or pets.  I believe the cleaning crew is taking him for a fool. We had to open up a case with Airbnb because he just kept insisting we pay an extra fee for his horrid, disgusting, nasty dirty house. Honestly worst stay ever through Airbnb.

Due to covid you would think the owner would make sure their cleaning team would take all Per cautions and keeping the home clean and safe for the next renter. The floors were dirty stuff spilled on them and you can tell they have not been cleaned in a good while. The home is left the way the people prior that stayed there leave it. The lights in the hallway as in the stair case do not work none of them as my mother Inlaw fell and hurt her self due to no lighting. The light in the loft does not work as well yes there is a lamp to connect but the plugs do not work they even have burn marks so we were kinda scared to try to plug more stuff not knowing if there would be a shortage or a burn out from that plug. Locking the door was a hassle and I tried to get ahold of the owner yet no response till the next day which was very inconvenient knowing we could leave our stuff there and the door not being able to lock and if anything went missing in their home we would be accountable for. So number one rule in renting out an Airbnb you should always be able to get in contact with the owner at any time for any reason if something is not right or goes wrong with the home. In this case not being able to lock the door so we could leave is one main thing. I spent over an hr trying to make sure the door would lock and no answer from owner cuz he said he was out of town. Also walking into the room they look clean yet again the floors were dirty the beds well the covers were not washed and they smelled. They had over people hair and dirt on them. So I had to take all the covers off from all the beds and put them to wash which is unfair knowing we are being charged a cleaning fee. The master closet omg that carpet is disgusting you can feel the nasty from it. So when renting this home please make sure to wear shoes or sandals at all times cuz your socks if white will be dirty from just a few seconds walking in them even your feet. Please check the bed covers if they were even washed or cleaned at all. The backyard in the pictures was one reason we wanted to stay but when we went to the backyard it was dirty and not a space you could hang out. The chairs had not been cleaned in god knows how long and there is a family of mice that scared us while walking out there. There are big roaches in the home so check your bags before leaving so you don’t take none back home with you. Before leaving I did take all the bed covers off my self to make sure they get washed and put them in the washer and upon throwing the trash outside, well there was no room for that. The trash was over filled he has 2 bins and both were over filled to the point they don’t close and trash was on the side as well. You can tell that trash has been there for over 2wks. Going to the side of the house to throw trash a rat came out and scared me. After the cleaning and washing of Mr Alecs home my family and I were able to relax. The home in my point of view was dirty not sanitized due to covid, nor clean for the next renter. The beds were okay to sleep in, the kitchen was useful the couches comfy but we did have to spray them down with febreze because they do have a dirty smell. Before leaving the home I did take pictures on how my family and I left it cleaned. Also in master bath the tub sounds like it about to break and the plugs did jump as we were using the bathroom ones and could not turn them on since the breaker is in the garage and it’s locked. So if you need to use the plugs in the restrooms they don’t work or if they do, not at the same time. Be safe the plugs have burn marks. On a good note area is nice and safe good neighborhood.  There is also a store close by and it is close to alot of shopping centers. FYI the walls are paper thin as you can hear everything.

The house itself was clean but I would not stay again after my experience with the host. The most inconvenient part of the trip was that Kels waited to tell us the freezer wasn’t working until after we checked in. We also found out later that evening when I was going to make my daughter some milk, that the refrigerator wasn’t working either. Since our house has been under construction I was really looking forward to cooking but that was impossible without a refrigerator. The refrigerator was  fixed 2 days later after to visits from the repairman. After the repair we asked for compensation for spoiled groceries, takeout while we waited for repair, and a refund for the 2 nights. Kels didn’t agree but did end up refunding for the groceries and takeout. <br/>We later asked to book an extra night since painting at our home was running behind. Kels said he needed to charge an extra $100 on top of our current rate since it was Memorial Sunday. We didn’t think this was fair and that he was trying to make up for money already refunded to us so we said no. <br/>During our stay we also found a gas leak outside while playing with our daughter. I immediately let Kels know. After no response called the gas company for him. I also stayed at the home to be present for the gas company since that was required by them. After Kels messaged me back he said his Dad would show to take care of it but he never did.<br/>This is the most disturbing interaction - 1 day after checking out of the Airbnb I receive a photo of a knob on a gas stove that is slightly turned. Kels then asks if I intentionally left the gas on at the stove in the Airbnb. I was shocked when I saw the message. He was asking me if I intentionally left the gas on to hurt someone.

However, Kasa’s listing was not found to be accurate upon arrival to our unit. We were unable to even enter the elevator due to the virtual check-in being broken. Had we been one hour later, the gracious staff at the building (not owned by Kasa) let us up, only to discover that our parking pass didn’t work so we had to pay $48 to park for one night despite the listing indicating free parking was included with our stay. Kasa did say the would refund this money, but due to below issues and us leaving we did not get refunded. Upon further inspection of our unit, we discovered several cleanliness concerns including dirt, hair, rust, and leftover food on some utensils from prior guests. Furniture was also broken (TV stand, vanity, couch). We reached out to Kasa with our concerns and they were willing to move us to another unit, though we requested to leave due to overall cleanliness issues of the building air vents were very dusty. Additionally, we had booked a stay for a full week and were granted one roll of toilet paper, 2 towels which were stained, and had no soap in the bathroom. I can understand and was willing to overlook a few of these issues all of them together we felt it was best to leave. We asked Kasa to refund the nights remaining on our stay so we could go somewhere, and they refused resulting in us having to dispute the stay with Air bnb who provided us a full refund for the remaining nights in order to allow us to finally enjoy our vacation. We will unfortunately not be staying with Kasa again.

Before we even stepped into the unit they called us and made us sign agreements that we would not smoke or talk loud after 10 pm. They said that they have noise decibel meters and very sensitive smoking detectors. All that is fine, but if you know that you have very sensitive smoke detectors the least you can do is have a decent stove? At first they told us they would move us to a different unit, next thing they sent some soap and a couple of scrubbing pads (I guess they expected us to clean the stove?) I called them, they apologized and then said that they would send someone the next day (which still left the stove rusty so we did not use the stove again).

Issue was unresolved by the end of the trip, so fair warning - we did receive a partial refund from Airbnb. Please note that this is not your traditional Airbnb experience - this house is managed by a business that just copy-pastes fear-mongering messages and contracts to you prior to your arrival. Lots of all caps, lots of unenforceable contract agreements that you don't have to respond to - they oddly don't seem to care. Finally, we tried to get a refund prior to arriving as the house was under a boil water notice, and the area was under a state of emergency, but as soon as we requested this from the host they became unresponsive and stopped communicating to us. Our check-in was late due to housekeeping trying to kill the ants and the location is in an alley off the highway exit near a bunch of homeless camps.

I am not sure if they have a cleaning company in between each stay but they are not doing their job at all. The floors were absolutely filthy. If you walked around the house in bare feet or socks, they were black within minutes. The living room curtain has a massive stain in it. The walls, doors and door handles were filthy. There was only two extra rolls of toilet paper for 8 people for three nights and no laundry detergent. We had to go buy our own toilet paper and laundry detergent. The fridge was not working when we arrived. The downstairs sink kept leaking even after a person came to fix it. The temperature could not be turned down and was locked the first day. It was over 90 degrees so the house was a sauna. This was spring time in Austin, I can not imagine what it will be like in the summer. There were not enough towels when we arrived and they were very dirty and stained.

One of us had to work remotely the entire time inside the apartment and having anyone come to touch up on cleaning, would have been very disturbing. <br/><br/>From the moment we entered, there was a HORRIBLE SMELL OF MILDEW throughout the apartment, which was not masked at all by the cheap, chemical air-freshener plugged  into the wall. We all got terrible headaches from this awful smell of that permeated everything inside the apartment. <br/><br/>The photos posted are very DECEIVING, they show a bright and light place tastefully decorated. However, the entire apartment has virtually NO NATURAL LIGHT at all. All the lights had to be on in order to ""see"" at any moment of the day inside this apt. <br/><br/>Several of the porch blinds were missing and people walking into the building could see us sitting on the living room couch at all times of day or night, again NOT PRIVATE. The porch was barricaded by two dark and old walls on two out of three sides. The only, small porch opening faced the narrow parking lot and the street. Everyone walking into the bldg. and/or the pool passed by this porch. In fact, it felt totally unsafe because at any moment anyone from the outside could walk onto this porch uninvited! NOT SAFE for single travelers. We never got out to sit on the porch, it was dirty on top of it. <br/><br/>The bathroom window above the tub is not functional, it is completely barricaded with tacky dark paint/paper?! The toilet was not flushing for an entire day, the bathroom sink drained super slowly and there were 2 toilet paper rolls provided for an entire week, one was half used and the other one was under the sink, so cheap! This place lists as ready for 4 people, yet only 3 sets of towels are provided and the second bed, the sofa was not made for us upon arrival.<br/><br/>This was a LOUD unit, with noises from people walking by the front door and people directly upstairs, as well as behind the bedroom. The bed was positioned directly under a narrow window that faces the communal pool, which is super close to the window. It was very hard to sleep because there are bright, neon lights around the pool shining through the completely closed blinds above the bed, all night long! <br/><br/>Couple of nights in a row, there was loud music and party noises well passed  11:30 p.m. On top of this, the bed sheets smelled dirty, were wrinkled, and the bed comforter had obvious stains on it. It was simply placed two loose sheets, not tucked inside a cover. We could not help but wonder if any of these linens were even changed/washed!  <br/><br/>Overall, this was our worst Airbnb experience we have ever had. It is really embarrassing how FALSELY it is ADVERTISED and presented for a substantial amount of money! It definitely made us feel as if the owners only care about PROFIT OVER QUALITY and HONESTY! <br/><br/>Location becomes completely irrelevant if you are staying in a DIRTY, MOLDY, NO VENTILATION, NO PRIVACY, DARK, OLD place that is ""made up"" with cheap ""make-up"" into something that is far from reality.

We were hoping that was just a fluke and would not be an issue, but we continued to notice more and by the end of the weekend, counted almost 20 COCKRAOCHES total. And these were not small cockroaches. They were big disgusting roaches and we found them alive, dead, and half dead in the common areas, bedrooms, downstairs bathroom, and 1 unfortunate member of our party woke up with them IN HIS BED 2 nights in a row. Absolutely disgusting.<br/><br/><br/>But maybe worse was our host’s response. Now you would think as disgusting and completely unsanitary as this situation is, that we would get an apologetic and urgent response to resolve this issue but this was not our experience. As soon as we realized this cockroach issue was as serious as it was, we contacted the host and they sent someone out the first day to spray the bugs. That night we noticed there were still roaches but most of them were dead or mostly dead. However the next day the problem continued with even more roaches and so we contacted our host again, and this time they did not send anyone but instead made several excuses that did not make any sense as to why they didn’t send maintenance to remedy this issue. We continued to try to reach out and quickly realized they were not really trying to help solve this urgent issue for us. Instead they consistently were gaslighting us on the phone. The host told us on the phone that “they couldn’t send someone in the unit when we were there” after we told them we would be gone most of the day and they already sent someone the day prior. The host also said that they couldn’t spray bug spray since we had our own stuff in there, but that was literally what they did the day prior so again it made no sense it all. It was very clear that excuses were just being made and they were not really interested in solving this situation and kept talking in circles. This really put a huge damper on our whole weekend where most of us travelled from all corners of the country to try to enjoy a vacation together. And much of the entire weekend was spent worrying about cockroaches in all the rooms and in some beds, and then worrying about trying to remedy the issue ourselves since the hosts did not remedy it for us. Furthermore we have to worry about possibly taking these nasty bugs home with us and causing further infestation.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Because of our negative experience with their poor communication and response to our problem, we were forced to finally take up the problem with AirBnb and got a partial refund (though we arguably should have had a full refund due to how bad the situation was). How can you charge someone to stay in a house completely overrun by giant cockroaches sleeping in your bed?!?!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>While the house itself is pretty nice and has a nice backyard, an INFESTATION OF ROACHES BEING UNADDRESSED is a serious dealbreaker. Also, the game room with 4 beds in it is a converted garage, NOT a bedroom, which is where the cockroaches appeared most frequently.

Those were the things we ran into issues with. <br/>I requested a refund on the cleaning fee but was declined because the host said we didn’t take pictures of the sheets and the drain was a maintenance issue. They also said that we didn’t inform them of the drain until after the stay was a reason for the decline. I figured I would let them know once we left so they could take care of it when no one is there. We did take pictures of the drain. We left the dirty sheets in the closet for them to take a look at but didn’t take pictures of them. <br/><br/>As I wrote in a note to them, it’s disappointing and unfortunate because the two main things someone would expect to have during a stay are clean sleeping and a properly working shower.

This is my first time leaving a non 5-star review but I feel the need to share my experience with you so that you can avoid this place at all costs! My check-in time was 3pm, and upon arriving close to 4pm there were maintenance employees inside the building. The employees then continued to work and even informed my GF and I that they would need to come back later that evening to finish what they started. On top of them running around the house long after check in, there was no shower curtain or liner in the only bathroom. The staff told me the shower curtain had been washed and to remove it out of the dryer... when I took it out of the dryer I found it was covered and I mean SOAKED in urine. Absolutely horrific experience. It had never been washed. I messaged the host informing him of this, and he blamed the previous guest and said he would have someone bring me a new shower curtain the next day. Well, THEY NEVER DID. After following up, they then told me to ""just use the liner."" There was NO LINER. Anyway, long story short, neither my girlfriend or I could shower all weekend. He never resolved the issue, and by the time checkout came, the entire upstairs started to smell like pee. When I told him I would be leaving a review he tried to offer me pathetic hush money ""after the 14-day review period ends"" which I already informed Air BnB about and found hilarious.

It was conveniently located North of downtown but only 2 blocks from freeway so only about 5-7 minute drive downtown and only 10-15 minutes from the Domain. The neighborhood is decent, right off the highway are a couple taco food trucks that are delicious and a good number of homeless, but they were never seen on our road. There is a small school so traffic can be busy during the beginning and ending times for school. Plenty of parking provided, and a small area for pets to use bathroom. <br/>Inside:<br/>When we arrived we did feel like it had a rushed cleaning job. We ended up sweeping the entire apartment and moving furniture to clean under prior to unpacking our things. The water lines for the shower were hooked backwards so we thought we didn’t have hot water at first. The water pressure for downstairs is poor, and even worse when the temp drops. The internet is spotty, so if you have business meeting plans or game, be very weary. The mattresses need to be replaced, they are both very bad on your back, the bed is the smaller room is significantly worse. For the prices they are asking the beds 100% need to be replaced! It was nice having washer and dryer available, never any issues with those or any other appliances. They do have monthly pest control, in 3 months I saw only 4 bugs total in the kitchen, but with having 3 sliding doors that we left open often I was not surprised or did not think this was an issue. No roaches were ever found by us. <br/>Hosts:<br/>Hosts were responsive when we reached out. The only issue they were unable to fix was the spotty internet, but they did offer to reset for us since we did not have access to router. The hosts are unable to provide a key for mailbox, so plan on not having access unless you talk with mail person when they are delivering then they will open box to check for your mail.<br/>Pricing:<br/>I think this place is priced on the higher end for what is offered, but with Austin housing is going up everywhere. Towards the end of our stay we asked about extending our stay and were notified they are no longer doing extended/monthly rates. The rate for 1 month would have been higher for the entire 3 months we stayed.

After our first night, I had a terrible fright in the kitchen when I noticed that the bananas I left on the kitchen counter had huge human-size bite marks. Realizing it can only be a rodent, I messaged the host who said she would send over her cleaning unit to look into it. After speaking with my husband we decided to leave the place. We have a three-year old, and we just couldn’t stay at a place where rats may be around at night. When I told the host this, she said I can’t get a refund due to her cancellation policy. And that previous guests have not complained about this. This is after I sent her pictures of food eaten by the rodent/s. My husband also discovered the plastic container of croissants we left out on the kitchen counter had been gnawed into. The plastic in one corner was clearly cut through and one of the croissants was pulled out and bitten into. I sent these pinto the host too and called Airbnb customer service. I spoke to agent, sent the pictures and we checked out as soon as we could. AirBnB decided the issue was covered by AirCover and issued a refund.  The cleaning fee is quite high for this listing, and this is not included in AirCover so I lost more than $200 in cleaning fee and taxes. We checked into a hotel instead. <br/><br/>I wasn’t judicious in choosing a place in an apartment complex with a young child. I’ve lived in an apartment complex in the South before. The thing with apartment complexes is that if your complex has a rodent issue then it doesn’t matter how much you clean your individual unit. All crevices and cracks need to be sealed completely for your unit to be free of rodents, and this is really hard. <br/><br/>I don’t like leaving negative reviews, but I wanted to let others with children or those who are sensitive to rodents  know of this issue with this listing so they don’t go through the same experience as me.

The space in the apartment was very good, especially the 4 bedrooms plus loft, difficult to find that so close to downtown.  Location is right on campus so their are loud frat houses across the street. Easy spot for getting ubers. Secure garage for car. But we were very disappointed in the upkeep and quality of the apartment. Right when you walk in you notice a very pungent smell, which I believe to be mold. In the bottom drawer of one of the bathrooms, their is mold growing in the drawer. The walls are very dirty and paint is chipping, cupboards in bathrooms are also damaged. The one sink in bathroom was plugged from the moment it was first used and never did drain that water for our entire stay. Over 3/4 of the vanity light bulbs did not work, nor did the bedroom lamps have functioning light bulbs. Grout in the other bathroom shower and floor is disintegrating and very dirty. Carpet in bedrooms isn’t tacked down and would come up every time you tried to shut the door.  Yes, I could have reported some of these issues to be resolved during our stay but when I’m on vacation I don’t want to have to deal with conversing/organizing a maintenance person’s arrival since we had plans to be gone during the day and we were not comfortable with a stranger being in the apartment when we weren’t there. These are all maintenance issues that are very visible and should’ve been addressed PRIOR to our arrival.  This isn’t something you have a lot of control over but the apartment halls are also terrible- the floor is covered in pigeon poop and right above your door a pair of pigeons sat the entire time we were there so you have fresh poop on the floor in front of door along with feathers all over your entrance rug and door.",2021-11,-0.9049,1863,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

To start it off our stay was originally scheduled for February of 21 when the large ice storm that affected much of the southern US hit. We reached out asking to reschedule after our area had received so much snowfall that we physically couldn't get our cars out of our homes. The host informed us that this was not an option and there was nothing he could do. Then just a few days before our stay he reached out saying that the plumbing at the stay was out due to the storm so we would need to reschedule. So, we were expected to be flexible and understanding of his situation after he was neither in our situation.  We rescheduled and initially upon showing up things seemed to be okay... for the first five minutes. The pictures you see on the website are extremely misleading.  Upon arriving the house is tucked behind a shack...literally ready to fall down. The whole thing is dirty and run down, one of the bathroom doors is only secured with a rubber band, and there was a lamp on the wall hanging by a thread that fell off the moment we touched it to make sure it was secure. There is a dog out back that barks all night every night and multiple nights in a row we heard gunshots just down the street. Then on our second morning shortly after waking up we walked into one of the bathrooms to find a SWARM of TERMITES flying around and a huge dead roach under the bed. We immediately tried to message and call the host several times with no response. We then received a call from someone else saying they were with a realty company so we explained to them the issue and they said that someone would be coming right out. We had plans for the day and no longer felt comfortable being in the home so we went about our day. We got back hours later to find that no one had in fact been out and the termites were still in the home. We then called the host back with still no direct answer. The same realty company called back saying that since it was a Sunday no one would be able to come until the next day. They genuinely had no issue allowing their guests to stay in a termite infested home for a full day. We then reached out to airbnb themselves to hopefully get some help which didn't go any better. After a phone call with an airbnb representative explaining the situation they said to give them 15 minutes and they would set up hotel accommodations. 30 minutes later I still hadn't heard anything so I called back and all I was told was that I would get a call back soon. Well a few hours and another call to airbnb later with the same "" We're so sorry to hear about your experience, a "" SUPPORT AMBASSADOR"" will be reaching out to you shortly"".  What a joke! <br/> No one reached out whatsoever, least of a SUPPORT AMBASSADOR!  Apparently, airbnb also deemed it acceptable to leave us in the bug infested home for the night. It's shocking that a company the size of airbnb has no contingency plan for true emergencies.  So, you're on your own folks if you are ever in need.  We ended our trip a day early,  but the whole experience made us miserable and completely destroyed our trip. We did get a full refund, which was the least they could do after the fact.

First, I will say the property was beautiful and well-equipped at first glance. The beds were comfortable and house was clean. <br/><br/>That said, we did experience a lack of hot water during our stay, which was uncomfortable for all guests, including our 2-year-old. We were four adults and a toddler. <br/><br/>One of the adults in our party travels with a service animal and though the property description says pets are not allowed, we reached out to the owner before arrival and he was very accommodating in permitting us to bring the dog with us after providing him with the reason for the service animal's support. <br/><br/>On the second day of our stay though, we experienced very poor customer service and behavior from the property manager and owner that we are still very much confused about as we were having a pleasant stay up until that point.  <br/><br/>As we were getting ready to leave for lunch, the fire alarm went off due to vapor from a hair dryer. The property manager texted and asked if everything was okay, and we said yes and shared the reason for the alarm. Furthermore, the service animal’s owner decided he felt well enough that day to leave the dog at home while we stepped out for a quick lunch (took medical precautions) and he left the dog in the bathroom in order to ensure the dog did not jump on the furniture while alone, as requested by the property owner, though the dog is well trainer and does not not show that type of behavior. <br/><br/>We assume the property owner stepped by to check on the house (his house’s guest house) as we received a text that the dog was barking, but the dog is trained to only alert when someone is at the door. In addition, the front door was unlocked, which we very clearly made sure to lock before heading out. He asked that we come get the dog and we immediately did so to ensure the owner was not uncomfortable with the situation. <br/><br/>We later arrived and noticed there was still no hot water. We asked for help and were met with false accusations of breaking many house rules and a lack of support with utilities from the property manager saying she “could call a plumber but it would take a week.” She mentioned the owner “knew” we were smoking in the home, which was entirely false, and that he could “see” we had many people with us, which again, we were 4 adults and a toddler (house accommodates 6). She said they were confused because we never told them how many people were staying nor who each person was, which in past experience with Airbnb’s those details have never been needed as long as our group is within the number of people allowed. The property manager would not answer our calls and instead texted us not to contact the owner as she was “trying to calm him down and help us” when we are not exactly sure what the concern was nor needed any help outside of getting hot water. <br/><br/>We asked if she could tell us which house rules the owner thought we broke, but to this day have not received a clear answer. We did not appreciate being falsely accused of smoking in the home, breaking numerous house rules nor lying to the owner, as we did no such thing. To make matters worse, when asking for help with the water heater, the response received was much along the lines of “you have broken many house rules. I can call a plumber but it will take a week. If you have other suggestions, let me know”. This atrocity of a response and lack of willingness to help, on top of the false accusations and overall harassment we felt, ultimately pushed us to leave Austin early and cancel our last night at the property. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this location to anyone due to the poor management, lack of customer service and uncomfortable situation we were pushed into by the owner without any explanation or willingness to discuss with us directly.",2022-02,-0.8764,3960,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The mattress is a thin foam mattress on a wooden pallet a couple inches off the ground.<br/><br/>Also, you share the bathroom. It's impossible to keep it dry. And the walls are thin, so you hear everything. Everything. You'll have zero privacy.<br/><br/>I didn't want leave too terrible of a review with the 3 stars. We'll see if/how the host rates me now.<br/><br/>I really hate leaving bad reviews. it's bad for Airbnb overall.  With this in mind, I felt leaving this review is in everyone's benefit. I definitely like Airbnb. I've only taken a few trips now and this was my first ""bad"" and scary experience. It's not pleasant when you see a message that a host is essentially trying to scam me. Case in point, they also attempted to charge me $25 for clothes hangers. If i accidentally took one or two, I'm very sorry, however, it's not a $25 expense...

The room had several spiders and is more of a large closet as opposed to a guest room. A note for people unfamiliar with the area is that there are train tracks running between the bnb and South Lamar, so it is a long walk south to get to a crossing (Alamo Drafthouse takes 25 mins to walk to). Still less expensive than some other bnbs around, but owner will not give refunds for any reason as I found out during the pandemic when she kept my deposit despite state mandates shutting down my travel event weeks before my check-in date.

There were a number of problems, and we ended up canceling our stay.  To begin with, it's not well maintained. The front door is slightly dirty, the entry light was not working, the closet door off one of the bedrooms was unhinged, the thermostat was falling off  the wall, one of the stairs was broken, and there were holes in one of the walls and doors. As a guest, this is annoying and time consuming because you have to document it and message the host to make sure you don't take the blame for it when you leave. In addition, the townhome is sparsely furnished and the appliances are incredibly cheap. The bedside lamps, for example, have a USB plug, but there is no USB port - I don't know how we were supposed to use them. The towels were made out of some weird microfiber material that I use to clean the kitchen, and there were no hand towels. There are no chairs besides the 2 barstools, pillows were pretty old and dirty. The host was very responsive and nice, but he couldn't attend to any of those items until the next day, so we canceled our stay as we did not feel it was worth the bother.  If you are not fussy, and just need a place to pass out, it's fine.

The Airbnb was extremely spacious, had very comfortable beds, and the host was quick to respond to any messages. Wifi is very fast and was able to support 2 people working from home with simultaneous video conference calling. The garage was a bit snug for our chevy suburban (and had an awkward lip you have to drive over) but there was plenty of street parking that we just opted not to use the garage. <br/><br/>Some smaller things to note: Google maps takes you to the wrong address one street over, which was confusing during check-in. Stove can be a bit finicky to turn on, and like most other Airbnbs, pots and pans were quite scratched so if you plan to cook a lot during your stay, consider bringing your own.

Firstly, when we arrived to check in (which was already about 30 minutes later than the check in time) we opened the door to the airbnb to find someone still cleaning the house and he let us know that the people before us had trashed it so much that not even the maid would clean it, and that the sheets were oily. We just waited around until he was eventually done cleaning, so we had a late check in and the host hadn’t ever let us know he was done cleaning. We just had to hope he was gone. Then the next day a maid unlocked our door and walked into the house. Very odd situation, especially since the host wasn’t keeping us updated on any of this. Also we were woken up Friday and Saturday nights because the neighbors were all outside until at least 3 AM and one of the nights there was a fight right outside of our window.

I was on the road for several days and reached out mentioning i arrived early and wondering if i could drop a few things off and shower a bit before check-in. She said no and was fairly dismissive, which is totally reasonable as there are clear check-in times, however when I arrived there was no towel.. anywhere. There was no towel to shower and no hand towel that one would use after washing their hands. It wouldn't typically be a big deal but i did specifically mention I wanted to shower. There are also reviews saying they were made to use the outdoor shower, but her check-in instructions only mentioned where the bathroom was, not which shower to use. Given these shortcomings i had to go shower in a gym. <br/>There were also incredibly strict instructions for mask wearing, hand sanitization, etc.. which I would be endorsing of (I'm a doctor that works exclusively with high risk patients) except her mandatory hand sanitizer is a tiny highly fragrant alcohol based spritz which would require about half the bottle to appropriately sterilize one's hands. <br/>Lastly, her dog barked a good deal of the night which made sleeping challenging. None of these things alone would be huge deals but put together it made for a bad stay. <br/>Between the dismissive communication, missing supplies, strict yet ineffective recommendations, barking dog, and unclear showering instructions I would just pay a little extra and go somewhere else.",2021-06,-0.2415,1523,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

First and foremost, you are not getting what you pay for, and having to pay for parking is a major inconvenience given what you are already paying for this location. My friends and I decided to come down to Austin from Dallas to celebrate and have a good time, but the fact that this house had so many problems didn't help. We didn't have a working toilet the entire time we were here, so imagine 6 different people sharing one toilet, and to top it off, one of the showers was broken. It was a major inconvenience for each and every one of us. As we arrived Friday evening, I emailed about the problem early Saturday morning and was told that someone would be out to fix it as soon as possible, but no one showed up all day Saturday. I then called to make sure they were aware of the urgency of the situation and was told that someone would be dispatched as soon as possible, but this was not the case. We went out for dinner around 10:30 p.m., and we still didn't have a working toilet. When I returned a little after midnight, they had finally arrived to fix it. About time, right? Unfortunately, we checked out early on Sunday morning, so we struggled with only one restroom for 6 people Friday night and all day Saturday.

However, the check-in process was awful and I know that many people had problems with it as well. ( I befriended another poor girl in the lobby that was also looking for her Air Bnb late night having the same issues as me and was lost, confused and scared).<br/><br/>I suggest a different code to get into 1614 building versus the 1630 building and more clear check in instructions. For example, ""IF YOU ARE IN THE BUILDING NEEDING A KEY FOB AND CEMENT FLOORS, IT'S THE WRONG BUILDING, PROCEED NEXT DOOR"" (of course this would never be necessary to even state if the other building just had a different code)... as it should already.....<br/><br/>When you are unfamiliar with the area and dropped off in an Uber during the night, it makes it difficult to know where you are or to identity a building number etc. <br/><br/>Since the code I was given granted me access to the building, I had no reason to believe I was in the wrong building. <br/><br/>When I entered the building I quickly realized there was a key fob box and that it was necessary to obtain a key fob to grant access anywhere in the building. I was very confused about the key fob situation since that was never mentioned in the email. I proceeded to type in the same code they gave me for the door, it did not work, I had to sneak a ride up on the elevator with another guest.<br/><br/>Once I arrived to my door, exhausted after a 14 hour day of travel, I quickly realized the code that was given to me did not open the door. I tried repeatedly before calling maintenance. He said he would come within 30 min, however after about 5 min of waiting, the door randomly unlocked itself and opened...<br/><br/>When I needed support, I felt I had no-one to actually speak to. I felt stranded and scared. Instead I was told they could not call  me and gave me the, ""on-site"" maintenance man's number and he was actually 30 min away. He was very un-aware of what was happening. He first mentioned that I was in the wrong building, the next question was, ""what are the floors? Cement or carpet?"" when I responded, ""cement"" he confirmed I was in the correct building....<br/><br/>After the door randomly unlocked, I called the maintenance man back  to tell him I no longer needed him to come as I was able to get in, he informed me that he was able to unlock the door from the app on his phone. <br/><br/>After entering the apartment, I quickly realized it looked nothing like the pictures and was highly disappointed. additionally, the wifi code didn't work. <br/><br/>I still had no reason to believe at this point that I was in the wrong room since the room was set-up and ready for guests, water bottles, welcome letters, clean etc . <br/><br/>My friend arrived later than me and was stuck waiting in the lobby until 5am since she was waiting for someone to use the elevator so she could also sneak a ride up. She was exhausted! we ended up having to waste half of our day to just sleep since we were up all night trying to figure out this disaster!<br/><br/>Such a shame as we only had the weekend in Austin and almost a full day was wasted since the check-in process was less than ideal. <br/><br/>When we awoke the next day, I had received a bunch of messages from Air Bnb stating that we were in fact in the wrong building and room.... SCARY!.... Like how does that happen!<br/><br/>We packed up our belongings and proceeded next door.. The building was much nicer, the room was clean and as pictured and the wifi worked! <br/><br/>Had we not had worst check-in process possible and a nights stay in the wrong and vacant random apartment room, I would've given this place 5 stars...<br/><br/>I demanded a refund however, they only refunded us for the the first night.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend the place but only if the check-in process was completely changed.

I'll start with the positives, the beds were comfortable, the airbnb is in a good location.  It was really nice to have 2 bathrooms. The couch was comfortable.  Issues we encountered during our stay....the most glaring negative was the odor of pot as we initially entered the apartment.  We didn't know if it was pot or just a musty smell from lack of air circulation in the apartment, but when we returned later that evening after going out to dinner the smell was even stronger.  I did let the host know, but we both felt it was more than likely a neighbor. No action was taken on the hosts part due to it more than likely being from a neighbor.  This greatly affected our stay.  We made a point to be in the apartment as little as possible since the smell bothered our entire family.  We even considered finding other accommodations, but since our stay was so short we decided to just stay.  The apartment also wasn't up to our standards as far as cleanliness.   We can't speak to the quality of the kitchen, we did not use the kitchen or any of the appliances.  I hate to write poor reviews, but we feel other travelers need to know our experience.

Upon arrival we noticed two things. One was the soaking wet floors from a cleaner who must have left literally minutes before we arrived and didn't attempt to dry them and two the pervasive stench of cigarette smoke that was attempted to be concealed by multiple air fresheners in the unit (unsuccessfully). It's a first floor unit and I was also struck by the fact that the blinds covered no more than 1/4 of the sliding glass doors, many of them were crumpled up in a corner, a few were precariously hanging from red masking tape. The first 15 minutes of our stay there my boyfriend and I spent using my athletic tape to put sheets up for a semblance of privacy. From there it was death by a thousand cuts.<br/><br/>- If you didn't wear shoes, your feet or socks turned black from the grime on the floor<br/>- found trash from previous guest under the bed<br/>- probably 2 inch period blood stain on the comforter that while washed should have been thrown out (they did send us a new one when asked, but ignored the complaint about the blinds which they had to have known about previously)<br/>- blood on the hairdryer (I'm a woman and a nurse I promise you I know what dried blood looks like)<br/>- they had advertised a TV with streaming services, aside from a jenky remote, every time we tried to play something the Roku would crash so we gave up.<br/>- dishes were put away wet.<br/>- when we went to use the clothes drier for their advertised on site laundry, it was so ineffectual it required being run twice to get our clothing par dried after 1.5 hours of dry time. <br/>- woke up to a cockroach in the shower.<br/><br/>Any one or even 2-3 of these things wouldn't make me leave a 1 star review, but the composite of finding some new gross thing every day of our trip made us seriously consider finding somewhere else to stay by the time the last night. Overall I had zero trust in anything being cleaned to even a reasonable standard which made me, someone who doesn't require impeccable cleanliness in general, extremely uncomfortable.

Some things I will note—there is a daily fee for your pet rather than a one time fee and you can not leave your pet unattended in the Kasa rental, which makes it difficult to do things all together as one person has to stay back with the pet. Kasa also has a noise sensor in the apartment which was a little weird. We are not the party type of people so it was fine, just seemed like an invasion of privacy. Additionally, the location of the Kasa is not ideal. The street over (Vargas St.), was extremely sketchy and while driving to get coffee we witnessed a few drug deals.

The location itself wasn’t too bothersome, it was mostly the loud neighbors on the top floor that were really noisy from 8pm - 3am, and while they say no smoking in the room - cigarette and weed run through the vents and filled the room. Cleanliness wise, the pull out couch had stains on the sheets, alongside with feeling the springs hitting every part of your body. The bed itself was clean, but rock hard, along with the pillows. :/ And unfortunately on all of our nights we stayed there (5), we found at least 2-3 cockroaches :( every day - which I feel is just due to the location. The blinds on the windows need to be fixed and are missing a few panels.. so the neighbors can see through the front and the back (where the bed is).

49344973,542011454775507093,2022-01-17,34751620,Seth,"I stayed here in January 2022.  The condo is super cute and the hosts have clearly put a lot of work into renovating and decorating.  And the host Meg is lovely and was always very quick to respond my questions.  Unfortunately, I would not stay here again unless the central air HVAC system has been replaced.  It does not function well and it simply cannot maintain a comfortable temperature inside the condo.  If you read the previous reviews you will see that a few guests mentioned that they had problems with the AC, but that the host was able to quickly ""resolve"" or ""mitigate"" the problems.  When I checked in, upon first walking through the condo I noticed that there are two very large free-standing AC units, which are not shown in the pictures.  Immediately I realized this was the ""resolution"" or ""mitigation"" to previous guests' AC complaints.  (When I bookd the reservation, based on the photos I assumed the condo had a central air HVAC system.  If I had known the condo requires additional ""free-standing AC units"" or a ""window unit AC"" or anything similar, then I would have never booked.)  There is one free-standing AC unit in each bedroom.  The unit in the first floor bedroom interferes with the ability to walk around the bed because of the small size of the bedroom relative to the large size of the AC unit.  Upon seeing that in the bedroom, my boyfriend was immediately shocked and suggested we complain to the host, leave the condo, and book a nearby hotel.  I suggested we simply move it off to the side out of the way since it has wheels and we wouldn't be needing AC in the cold January weather anyway.   So we did and we stayed.  Overnight the first night we found out that it was terribly uncomfortable inside the condo because the heat from the central air HVAC system was unable to warm the condo.  The next day during the day was fine, but in the evening the condo was again extremely cold and very uncomfortable despite running the heat from the central air HVAC all day.  So I notified the host it was too cold inside the condo.  The host asked if I had tried using the ""heat mode"" on the free-standing AC units.  I was not aware that those free-standing units had a heat mode.  So we immediately turned on the heat mode on those free-standing units.  This successfully warms the bedrooms, but the kitchen, living room, and bathrooms are still too cold. Additionally, any future guests should also be aware that the free-standing units are very noisy. So being a light sleeper, I did not get a good night rest for the next two nights.  Based on my experience during the winter, I have to assume that the summer months would result in the condo being too hot without using the large and very noisy free-standing AC units.  So despite the host's lovely personality and the nicely decorated condo, I would not stay here again unless the central air HVAC system has been fully replaced and the free-standing AC units have been removed.",2022-01,-0.9263,2967,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The communication was always fast and polite. They solved every problem they could. <br/><br/>It's also important that this review is for an apartment at the Corazon, not Soco based on a slight mix up. <br/><br/>Pros about the apartment: covered secure parking, great location.<br/><br/>First, the only complaint about the host is that the apartment isn't as well-equipped as I'm used to. I was there for a couple months. There were like 8 hangers, no toilet brush, no cleaning supplies, no outdoor furniture, and minimal kitchen utensils. For some people that might not matter but if you like to cook in, you should know. <br/><br/>Other things of note: the bedroom has large slat blinds so light comes in and it's hard to make the bedroom dark. The apartment was infested with bugs...even in the fridge which I've never seen before. The host tried to get it taken care of but there's only so much you can do. So i couldn't have any food in the apartment that wasn't sealed. And no produce. <br/><br/>This apartment (420) was right next to the trashroom. So there is a ton of noise and even more bugs than other apartments, I imagine. It's also right at the stairs and the freight elevator. Next time I use a serviced apartment I would ask about the exact location, assuming the apartments available are the hardest ones to rent. I would also always google the building for reviews before I confirmed a reservation. This one had a lot of complaints about safety and homeless people. I didn't experience any of this during my stay. <br/><br/>The other guests/residents are so messy it's shocking. There was trash in the halls every day, and dog poop in the hall and on the stairs. I've lived in many apartment buildings and have never seen anything like it. <br/><br/>So in a nutshell, I might rent another Bindel apartment but I'd ask a lot more questions about the location first and would know I needed to bring more of my own stuff. But, I would not spend another night in this actual apartment. In fact, I left 8 days early as I was just over it.",2021-07,-0.4396,2176,2,55.0,-1,Fake,Weak Negative

The outside table has sticky marks, there were dead bugs in upstairs shower,  the fridge crevice was full of old crumbs and the futons upstairs also had crumbs as well  (I attached a pic of everything mentioned above from when we checked in.  )<br/> We immediately noticed spiders and bugs and a lack of cleanliness.  When we went outside  the pool was beautiful however all the walkways around it were full of debris metal rubber leaves and sticks . The back fence is falling down , the outdoor area was over grown, the  grass nor greenery seemed to have had recently been tended too. Steps were full of dirt in every corner . See pictures. And Spiders were dropping down everywhere from the upstairs porch . <br/>Near the pool as we were taking a tour One of my kids immediately stepped on something sharp. From that point on everyone had to keep shoes on as the grounds were unsafe .  How is that fun or acceptable?<br/>Needless to say,  We spent our first evening killing spiders and cleaning spider webs only for the sun to go down and the roaches come out !!!!<br/>They were parading across the ceiling floors and coming out of the walls . It was a disaster! I wanted to leave so bad however my husband and kids had this planned for Mother’s Day and we had other plans in the city and vehicles rented as well that had already been paid for . So I sucked it up and cleaned so that I would be able to somewhat feel comfortable laying my kids down for bed . While in the process of killing roaches at about 11:20 pm we found the live scorpion in the upstairs bathroom. I called the 24 hour emergency line Renters Club-as Felton our direct rep was not responding, and no one even answered. What an emergency line!! <br/><br/>We checked in at approximately 430pm Friday and we killed bugs and cleaned all evening and I have texts to Renters Club-Felton as proof .  The next day we were promised the cleaners would come at 10-1030. Which was a delay in our fun as who wants cleaners they don’t know in the home with all their belongings. However 10 or 1030 wasn’t the case . They showed up at 11 . So from 430 the day before until 11 the next day we had to wait for them to arrive and 11-12 morning wasted wasted watching after the cleaning crew , And then after that Renters Club-Kim showed up with her blower to clean a filthy outdoor area when I made it clear that a pressure washer would really be necessary! She was only there approximately 35 minutes . When she left the outdoor area was still so bad ,we needed a broom. I had to request that they send her back with a broom .And y’all did send her back with a broom to leave me how unacceptable .The filth and bugs may be suitable for a group looking to party but it definitely was not suitable for a family with kids . However even a party would be mad to see the outdoor area filthy and inoperable. <br/>Kim got done with her cleaning at 1236 as that’s when I texted Renters Club asking for a broom . And then pest control came about 1 and said we couldn’t have the kids outside until the stuff dried and said it takes 30 minutes to dry. they left around 130pm. So from 2pm Saturday until 11 am Sunday is all we had in a somewhat maintained property. Renters club and this disgusting house wasted half my weekend . Oh and they have cameras facing the pool that were not mentioned in the listing . They deserve to have this listing pulled from Air bnb. The home is a safety hazard , infested with roaches and ran by a sub par rental company . In addition to illegally recording me! One plus is I didn’t get bit with any bed bugs! Yuck!

First, the place leaves a lot to be desired with cleanliness. They claim to have a cleaning crew come between guests, but I'm not sure what sort of cleaner would stand by the work done at this place. The floors were dusty and dirt/dust piled up in the corners of the rooms, (particularly in the master bedroom), the baseboards looked like they had never been dusted or scrubbed down, and the bathroom mirror had water drops and streaks all over it when I arrived. The place is also very dated and the updates were clearly just aesthetic choices for photos, because the place definitely isn't as nice as the photos would make it seem. Next, the back door was completely unlocked when I arrived, which was a major safety concern as I was traveling alone for work. Finally, my car got trapped in the garage for an entire day, which was an extreme inconvenience and led to hefty ride share charges that could have been avoided had I had access to my vehicle. I understand the garage door failing was not a direct issue of the host, but I discovered the door to be broken at 7am and it was not resolved until 10pm that night. Luckily, it was just me traveling for work so ride shares solved the issue, but I could not imagine if I had been a family relying on using a personal vehicle for car seat purposes or if I had accidentally left something I needed in my car. I did eventually get in contact with the host and they ended up sawing the garage door open so I could get my car out. However, it took longer than I would have liked to solve the issue and there were multiple times I got copy/paste messages from them (messages reminding me about taking our the trash before I left and to fill out a survey if I was leaving earlier than the 11:00AM travel time) that were clearly boiler plate language they send all their guests at certain times during their stay, but wasn't getting any updates about my vehicle being trapped in the garage. If I was the host, communicating with my guest about their trapped vehicle would have been my top priority before I even dared ask them if they were leaving early or reminding them to take out the trash. Overall, this whole stay left a very sour taste in my mouth and I completely regret booking at this property.

She also allowed us an extra hour for check out, which we really appreciated. The downstairs bed and bathroom were nice. W&D unit are new and worked well. <br/><br/>Unfortunately we did have a slew of concerns regarding our experience in the home itself. Upon entering, the smell of marijuana was pungent. The stench was extremely strong, which was disconcerting in general, but also in light of my three young children, ages 6, 4 and my newborn who is 3 months old. The ad boasts a “WOW” factor, though I don’t believe that is the “WOW” most are seeking.<br/><br/>Additionally, we were highly disappointed in the availability of basic items one would expect in a rental advertised for 8 guests. There were only 3 forks, less than half a paper towel roll with no extra supply, no hand soap in the kitchen or downstairs 1/2 bath, and only one hand towel in a house with 2 1/2 baths. One extra roll of toilet paper is also unacceptable.<br/><br/>The carpet felt grimy and dirty, and the downstairs floors also felt as they had not been thoroughly cleaned. <br/><br/>Upstairs in the two bedrooms, the beds were made up of thin sheets only.

My partner and I were staying here for accommodations after a surgery which we had mentioned to them, yet when we arrived, the airbnb was incredibly dirty. Upon entering, the suite smelled clean but we quickly realized that was because of a car air freshener shoved into the air vent. We found a fake nail (like the kind from a humans hand) on the floor, water damaged toilet paper, clumps of hair throughout, insanely dirty vents, lipstick on a glass, and blood splatters on the pillow case. When we mentioned it to evonify saying this was a health hazard, especially having open wounds post-surgery they refused to refund us and let us leave. We could not sleep in dirty and bloody sheets so we ended up contacting airbnb directly, who then contacted evonify. Evonify ignored all calls and messages for 7 hours until eventually airbnb went ahead and issued a full refund because the host was unreponsive. At this point it was 9pm and we were past all airbnb check-ins and without anywhere to sleep.

I drove all the way from Dallas got there early waited in the parking two hours before my check in time the cleaning lady show up and did not clean the apartment. I think she had a issue with getting in the apartment . Check in was at 3 I get a message saying that I wouldn’t be able to check in until after 4 didn’t get to check in until 5! The apartments were all bills paid so you couldn’t control the air or heat it was freezing in there. There were bugs all around the apartment in the inside of it. Communication was not good when they finally respond they just kept apologizing. I was told we could check out at noon instead of 11a.m. since we wasn’t able to check in at our original time. 11 a.m. check out day the cleaning lady walked in on me and my sister naked as we were getting in and out of the shower. I’m yelling we are still in here she still walks in saying we have to check out then I let her know I was told we can check out at noon. Then I received a message with a apology about the cleaning lady showing up early it was just a all around bad experience NEVER AGAIN WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO STAY HERE!!!!,2022-01,-0.8092,1180,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

Once we arrived at the location we were very shocked and disappointed. Nothing was the same as high-quality pictures and the modern look in the profile description of this place. We arrived around 3:30 PM at the place and found the garbage and some other cleaning items in front of the door.  we tried to ignore this welcoming scene and entered the door code and got scared, the cleaning lady was still cleaning the floor and we had to stay outside for about 1/2 hour. The neighbors were looking skeptical and awkward. We, on the other hand, were very uncomfortable and tired staying outside with our luggage.  Once we finally got in ( 1 hour after normal checking time) a malodorous smell hit our faces (which could be for no air conditioning, long-term trapped air, or cleaning material).  My friend and I had a long trip decided to take a nap, there was no blanket. Due to the late response of the host, we decided to go to Walmart and purchase a blanket. The house has serious pest issues. We found ants and cockroaches in the kitchen areas (counter and dishwasher) no cooking fun at all.  No relaxing shower eighter. The water pressure was terrible.

Full kitchen and washer and dryer (which we didn't use, we barely spent any time in the apartment. Really just used it for sleeping, showering and changing. Not hanging out, cooking or doing laundry.) <br/><br/>CONs: The floor in the bathroom has some water damage and the vinyl flooring is coming up. It looks bad as the first impression. <br/>It was almost 80* in Austin all week while we were there. Our AC was not working. After the first night, I texted about the problem and they asked for a picture of the thermostat, but then never replied again, and never offered a solution for the problem. The 2nd night still no AC - it was cooler outside than it was in the apartment, so we opened all of the windows. It was still quite muggy (in the 70's). Also that night when I went to take a shower there was no hot water. I didn't want to text anyone that late so I sent an email through the Airbnb site. The next day I texted again about the AC. (I never got a response from the email or subsequent texts)  <br/>The 3rd day I saw a maintenance man repairing the AC unit across the hall, so I went and talked to him myself. He explained that the whole building was on a very old AC and hot water system  and they were in the process of converting each unit to have their own. But there was no easy fix for the AC until the whole unit was replaced with individual units (which obviously would not be done in the next two days that we were there.) He also told me the no hot water last night was his fault that he didn't reconnect something after working on the AC the day before. (So that morning we did have hot water again). He offered us a solution even though the short-term rental units were not his responsibility; he brought us a single portable window unit. That cooled the living room well, but we each had to sleep with our bedroom doors open to have some of the cool air get to that end of the apartment. So the last two nights there were not as unbearable, but still it was not the same as having a fully functioning home air conditioning unit.  <br/>I understand the AC and hot water were a bit out of the Airbnb's manager's control, and there might not have been an immediate resolution, but the lack of communication after my complaint is what left me very frustrated. I would have been much more upset if I hadn't gotten the temporary fix that I did for the last two nights.",2021-12,-0.9806,2537,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

They would scream at us and cat call us every time we had to leave and get an uber.

A police officer was chasing him with his gun pointed screaming “get on the ground!” About 5 more cops cars sped down the street to get this man as we were all standing right there. We then crossed the street and waited for our uber when they tried to get the armed man out of the property. <br/><br/>The apartment needs a lot of maintenance and major upkeep done.

And a single hunting knife for cutting your food. There were other random utensils but no other spatulas or cutting utensils. The record player didn't work/play anything regardless of what we attempted - though there were records in the apartment. The T.V streaming services advertised were also misleading, the services are only available on the patio T.V; not the bigscreen inside, which you'll only be able to use if you sign into your own accounts or if you hook it up to your computer thru an hdmi. FYI, the patio/outside will likely be uncomfortably hot if you're not used to Texas heat. The sound for the inside T.V was connected to a BOSE sound system that both my friend and I couldn't for the life of us figure out how to turn on, messaged the host and they sent a simple instruction but it didn't actually clear up how to get it activated and rather than choosing to continue asking the same question to our host we simply accepted no sound on the inside T.V. There was a dead roach on the floor near the entrance when we arrived but other than that the spot was clean. One of the drawers on the desk had no bottom panel, and the T.V stand looked like it had been kicked in on the back side. I also inquired whether the outside T.V could be connected to the inside to use the Netflix and streaming services without having to sit out in the heat on the patio and the host messaged that the T.Vs did not connect. All things to consider if you plan on staying here. I commend the host on responding quickly when I messaged them. I suggest bringing all the kitchen utensils you'll need other than silverware. This listing needs to be updated to avoid a misleading experience.",2022-06,-0.9288,2118,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The balcony is cute and the bed was nominally comfortable. <br/><br/>We stayed one night in this room. We checked in to leave our bags and then immediately ventured out for the day and didn’t return until late, so we didn’t notice most of the issues until the next day and decided to bring them up when we checked out. We were offered a refund of the cleaning fee by the host initially but then told the actual owner didn’t want to give the refund because we didn’t address the issues when we first checked in. We understand that the hosts are representing an owner and don’t have full autonomy over refund decisions but it’s a worse experience to offer a refund and then not be able to give it than to never be offered it at all followed by a canned response saying that “we strive to earn a 5 star review, a 4 star review is considered negative”. Left an even worse taste in our mouths.

I’d highly discourage anyone from staying here because of unsanitary conditions and a very rude host/property manager.<br/><br/>They were uncommunicative prior to arrival. I showed up at the home at check in and found that it quite obviously hadn’t been cleaned from the previous guest. When I called the property manager to let him know, he informed me my check in wasn’t for another 15 minutes (instead of any sort of apology or expression of regret). What then transpired was just unacceptable. It involved a 2+ hour delay from checkin, waiting for cleaners to show up. At one point, the PM tried to convince me that a 20-30 minute cleaning for an apartment could be considered an adequate job (when I communicated I had a schedule to stick to). This cavalier attitude towards hygiene and cleanliness during a pandemic is very alarming. <br/><br/>I saw the host had another listing in the same unit and asked if I could go there. They said no. However, it was available to instant book on the app. Presumably, they didn’t want to offer it to me because it was a more expensive unit. Instead, they told me there was a Starbucks up the street where I could hang out while they cleaned the apartment hours after checkin. By the way, check in was at 4 - which is already a late check in. When I finally got to check in, I came back to find the front door unsecured even though I had communicated that I left my<br/>bags there.

There was no one in sight.<br/><br/>Then, the host refused to refund me anything for my terrible experience (which included wifi not working the entire time i was there) and instead tried to pressure me to leave early (although, he did use smiley faces when he reminded me I was welcome to leave). I had to go through Airbnb to get a refund. By the way, Airbnb saw me evidence and sided with me.<br/><br/>Cleaning miscommunication is one thing.

So when we attempted to do our first load of laundry we were going to use the starter laundry pods and dryer sheets that the hosts message AND house manual mentioned were under the kitchen sink. Well there were not any, so once again we reached out to the hosts and were met with the response of they don't supply those things for units without a washer and dryer. When I pointed out that their information on the unit said otherwise the response was that it's an automated message as most their spaces have a washer and dryer. How can the welcome message and the house manual both be wrong? This led to an incredibly frustrating and prolonged situation that could've been resolved by providing guests with accurate information. Also simple kitchen gadgets like a can opener were not provided. I could not shave my face because the bathroom outlet is ridiculously high, almost to the ceiling, so my cord wasn't long enough, my mom had to blow dry her hair in the living room.

Besides the items specifically listed as amenities that were not there, other misleading information included their claim to have a “fully equipped” kitchen, when there wasn’t even a microwave. They had a TV, but no way to watch anything on it. The couch smelled disgusting and was covered in pet hair, when they claim in their listing, “no pets.” We did not have hot showers, although the water would get hot at the sinks.

I’d like to start off by saying that I did not stay at the rental since I refused to give this individual anymore of my money due to his unprofessional communication and his dishonest / thieving rental practices. Let me lay it out for you: <br/>1. Extra charges for dog (any size) - $75 DAILY & explained to me that this was for the extra cleaning fee, when he already charges you (the client) $200-$250 for cleaning fee on top of rent when booking the place. I happen to have family that owns a cleaning company and I can tell you already $200-250 is already pretty hefty price for a deep cleaning of an apartment of that size - so, the EXTRA incremental DAILY charge of $75 for dog hair is ridiculous and downright thieving! Also, even if you pay for the dog at the the beginning while reserving your stay, he still expects you to pay this charge again before you can check in and claims that there is an error within the airBNB system… <br/>2. Extra charges for early check in and late checkout. $100 each or $175 for both. This includes just leaving your bags at the rental early! What a joke! And the cleaning team may still be there… even though you have paid for early check in?! Hmmm downright robbery! <br/>3. Extra charges for ANY guest that may step into the residence, even if just for a couple hours (not including spending the night). $25 per person per day! It was explained to me that this was to cover the toiletries, toilet paper, soap, and trash removal that EACH individual person uses. I was very specific in that guests would only be visiting for a few hours at most for ONE day during my stay, but it was still $25/day. Also, Black Opal can not figure out how to charge you for just one day of guest entry out of your multiple day stay, so they expect you to pay for an additional guest for each day of your stay even if you are only requesting to have guests come visit for one day only. This is when I decided to cancel my stay, because now this was beyond ridiculous and a HUGE waste of my time and money. He refused to fix the calculation/price issue and I refused to pay for multiple guests for multiple days, so I canceled and EASILY & QUICKLY booked a king suite at the Fairmont hotel for CHEAPER with better customer service, in a better part of Austin, and without surprise ridiculous extra charges. <br/>4. The place is in east Austin BTW! If you are from Austin, you know what that means…<br/>5. Austin is a dog friendly city (as are MANY cities in the US now) and most hotels and AirBnBs and VRBOs and whatever else you might use is very accommodating to animals. Fairmont Hotel had NO extra pet charges! <br/>6. Out of principle there are MUCH better places in Austin for you to stay that will not try to rob you of your hard earned money.

It has several maintenance issues that should be addressed. <br/><br/>To start off, we got to the unit at 3:10pm after check-in started at 3pm. We walked up to 3 guys actively spray painting the front door red. They told us we couldn't close the door because the paint was wet. The company managing this property was responsive to my messages asking about when we could get in and actually close the door and they said they were told the door was painted at 1pm and should be dry by 3pm. Clearly not accurate as there was literally paint being sprayed before our eyes after 3pm. Anyways we go off and waste an hour and come back. Get into the unit and try to relax. About 30 min after we were back, someone was clearly back at the front door working, pulling tape off the handle or whatever and such. But they never announced themselves to us, knocked, nor did I receive any messages warning me. Quite disconcerting and a shitty start to our stay. <br/><br/>Now on to the maintenance issues. <br/>1. the toilet valve is cracked and leaks water, the bowl barely fills with any water and struggles to flush and refill any water at all. It should be replaced. <br/>2. The faucet spout in the bathtub is not accurately secured. It should be properly mounted so it does not rattle loosely in the wall during use. <br/>3. Several kitchen cabinet handles are missing a screw so they just loosely hang and spin when pulled. <br/>4. Bedroom closet pull light is only secured with a single screw, making it lilt to the side and feel as if you're going to pull the light down onto yourself. Needs the second screw that the mount is designed for. <br/>5. The floors are disgusting. The damn glue from the vinyl planks is oviously leaking out everywhere. We had to wear shoes the entire time.<br/>6. There's no weatherstripping on the front door so you can easily see daylight and feel air coming through several gap areas. It also makes it hella loud since it is right next to the metal gate which everyone uses and slams closed. <br/>7. The unit smells like smoke. Seems like at a minimum, the air filters need to changed. It's quite gross. <br/><br/>Also, this unit is in an apartment complex with loads of bright LED security lamps. That's great until you get to the bedrooms whose wood blinds do not cover the entire window and they don't have blackout curtains in the room. We woke up at 3am every dang night with our bodies telling us it was daytime due to it being so stupid bright in there. Could have read a book with everything as closed and blocked off as possible. Desperately needs blackout curtains. <br/><br/><br/>TLDR;<br/>Pros: Central-ish location to North Austin. Clean surfaces and areas (excluding the floors). Off-street parking. <br/><br/>Cons : Clearly maintenance issues. Toilet may or may not flush depending on how recently it was previously flushed. Disgusting sticky floors.

The outside of the air bnb is an older apartment complex with the French broken and run down and was not expecting that from the pictures posted in the listing.

As I mentioned it’s an older apartment and the bathroom to shower is very small no room between the door and toilet which makes it hard when getting out of the tub. There is also no rug so you step on the floor if you don’t mind that then it’s not a big deal however I don’t like stepping barefoot on a dirty floor after showering. The restroom downstairs gets no ac/heating in it so it was very cold as temperature outside was in 40-50s. You could also hear everything from the next door neighbor them opening and closing doors, talking etc. The living room also has French doors however there is no blinds or curtains on it which made me feel uncomfortable with privacy. Lastly, the couch was extremely hard however since the tv is only downstairs and there’s not one in the bedroom I had to watch tv on my phone upstairs or put pillows and blankets on the living room floor as that was more comfortable than the couch.

We stood here for my bachelorette party and there was problem after problem. This house was called the hot tub royale and we were excited to be able to drink and relax in the hot tub. Before we got there they said that the people before us left the hot tub dirty so they would come by the next day and fix it. We called them and said we wanted it fixed as that’s what we payed for. They knew the hot tub problem wasn’t that it was dirty but rather it was broke which we found out after they “fixed it”. Instead of telling us it was broken they never said a word and left cold water in it knowing it would never heat up because it being dirty wasn’t the only problem. When they came and “fixed it” (refill the water) they also left the sliding door open and there were bugs in the house. The dishwasher was broken, the refrigerator and freezer were broken and our food went bad, the dryer which was under amenities was locked. The floors were dirty and our feet were black after walking on it. There were also poor response times. It was constantly we are sorry we will get back to you asap and it never happened. They said first thing in the morning it would be fixed (we were there for two nights) that next morning we heard nothing and once it rolled around to after 3pm we texted them again after many calls and texts the previous night. They finally answered after our attempt and not their own to make it right and said they wouldn’t be fixing it. DO NOT STAY HERE. This property sucked and you will waste your money. The property isn’t worth more than $100 a night and it was in a terrible area. Our Uber driver said you do not want to stay in this area and if you do you better not walk around at night.

Host didn’t offer to get them to us until the following day so we had to drive to family’s house at 10pm to get some.<br/>2. Only 3 towels were provided and no hand towels. Host did have those delivered the next day.<br/>3. Blinds were missing on the sliding glass door which limited privacy. Host did actually repair them our second day.<br/>4. Floors were not clean, cheerio on the bathroom floor, half a fake finger nail in one of the drawers.<br/>5. There is a very strong, musty, mildew smell that we can still smell on our clothes now that we’re home. This was very noticeable.<br/>6. Active wasps nest right outside the front door; host did nothing despite our requests.<br/>7. Missing lightbulbs throughout the house.<br/>8. The smoke alarms were not installed nor did they have working batteries. Host did remedy this on the second day. <br/>9. Porch light was burned out which made for a dark entry. I would not have felt comfortable had I been there alone.<br/>10. Tub has a slow drain so you’re showering in dirty water.<br/>11. Host only responded one time when he said the cleaners must have forgotten to leave the linens and that he’d have them delivered the next day. He never addressed or responded to any other questions or concerns.<br/>12.

The cookware is really small and poor quality, and so is the cutlery, making one of the big advantages of an AirBNB (the kitchen) not so useful. There were also some already opened containers of food, such as an opened bag of tostitos in the freezer, and cashews in the pantry. Not sure if they were left there on purpose, but regardless, I don't trust like that.<br/><br/>2. The unit is on the first floor, right against the loud street, while the listing boasts otherwise: ""balcony looks out into an unforgettable view of Downtown Austin"". What we really got was a patio (not a balcony) with a very forgettable view of an IHOP.<br/><br/>3. Wifi is extremely slow. The listing talks about 1Gb/s Google Fiber - multiple speed tests showed we were getting around 8-10Mbps, making it difficult to work remotely or stream anything. Party like it's 2002, I guess.<br/><br/>4. Location. For some people this might be a plus, but for us it wasn't. We aren't living the ""Greek Life"", so all the loud noise and partying and clogged streets (making it hard to get to the apartment at night) were just a headache, not to mention the drunk idiots being loud in the hallway in the middle of the night. In the morning you get to discover the random crap they leave on the floors of the apartment hallway and lobby, such as tree branches, beer bottles, and spilled food. If you are looking to party, this spot is great, just be aware of the potential downsides.<br/><br/>5. The host took (fairly minor) constructive criticism very poorly. For context, instead of purely written instructions to get into the unit, there are pictures of where to go with text on them with details - sounds great. However, these embedded pictures (not the ones for the listing) could not be expanded on the mobile app, so a lot of the text was cut off. I was unable to read the code because it was cut off. The host gave me the code and I notified them of the cutoff, but instead of acknowledging the obvious deficiency, they insisted (even after some back and forth) I should have used the desktop website and even ""printed out the [images]"". What is this, MapQuest? I don't know anyone my age who even owns a printer. They also said that it was hard to update the instructions because they have over 10 properties to manage. I guess it must be so difficult to manage so many properties :((((.  Firstly, it doesn't make sense for me to use the desktop website in this way when I'm traveling, with 15+ images for getting into the unit, most people are going to be following along in the app. Secondly, I had notified the host that I was displaced from my apartment after it had been out of power for weeks, so I didn't even have a place where I could easily print out jack ****.

Host had someone come back during our stay to clean again after I asked he wait until I return and not enter without me present- he entered anyways, even after “cleaning still very dirty after that and Bryan continually blamed “previous guests” but I’m confused how they would’ve caked dust under the beds and on every surface in the home on top of the fact the AC filters were disgusting and don’t look like they’ve ever been cleaned as to which bryan called this “light dust. Not once did Bryan take responsibility for his property he just made excuses and was extremely rude and made me feel unsafe entering the property against my wishes to clean *again* which shouldn’t have even been necessary. Hopefully host takes this as a learning experience because much of what was unclean was not from previous guests it was dusty and dirty from extended time without cleaning areas that weren’t right in the open - under beds, back of tv, inside microwave etc. overall very unhappy with my stay and would not recommend ever. On top of that this is a REHAB property at best. Cabinets scratched to hell, countertop broke in a few places, drywall mudding near AC vents needing to be sanded and painted but clearly the host has zero care for his properties as the state of this place shows. When I noticed Bryan ignored my request to stay out of the property until I was present I chose to stay with a friend for the remainder of my time and Bryan stated “you couldn’t have stayed with a friend you’re from chicago” and was again extremely rude - I’m an Aggie so unaware to him I have tons of friends in Texas and I DID stay with someone else after my privacy was completely disregarded and another 5% effort cleaning took place.

Since it is a new build there were some problems with the Ac and the lack of tv but things ended up working out.

We left the house in an amazing state with video proof yet we now have to pay $65 for a towel rack that was broken when we got there. Along with that he let us know that his last guest had broken the tv and that’s why we didn’t have one, which is understandable however now I have to wonder if this is a game to get things paid for in this new build.

Not enough dishes, coffee mugs, silverware, hand towels, soap, or wash cloths.  It says it sleeps 6 guests, but the home only provided 4 coffee cups.  Home only came with 9 spoons, so we had to keep hand-washing them to have enough.  Master bath had 2 sinks but they only provided 1 hand towel.  House had no wash cloths at all.  House had no bar soap at all.  They only provided head and shoulders 2 in 1 shampoo, so you have to take a shower with no conditioner, no bar soap, and no wash cloth.  House had no hangers, so I had to drape my clothes over the closet rod, but when I pulled them down, they were covered in dust from the closet rod.  House had no pen and paper, nothing to write on. House had 2 nightstands in master bedroom, but only 1 had a lamp, so the 1 person has to use their phone flashlight to go to bed.  Kitchen was not stocked as well as other air bnbs we’ve stayed in. Most of the kitchen cabinets were empty. The home shows a garage in the picture, so we were expecting to be able to park in the garage, but the garage was locked, so we had to park in the driveway, but there was no working light over the driveway, so you have to use your phone flashlight to go to and from your car at night, and you have to leave your car outside in the dark overnight. The porch light was not activated by light or motion, so unless someone turned it on before leaving the house, it’s dark when you come back, and you have to use your phone flashlight to see the key pad. There was no working light in laundry room (overhead light was not working and lamp was not working), so we had to use our phone flashlight to use the laundry room.  As of right now, while I’m writing this review, the home description does not reveal that the garage will be locked and not usable.  Overall, it was a good house.  It just needs sensor lights on the driveway and porch, interior lights fixed, to disclose that the garage is not part of the rental, and to be a little more stocked.",2021-12,-0.841,2315,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

She defended her listing by telling us that if we wanted to use the dock we should have asked (as clearly stated in her description), but we did not need use of the dock - We wanted to be near and see the water, which based on her EXTREMELY misleading photos looks to have been present at some point in time but no longer is. <br/><br/>Instead of putting the responsibility on your guests to inquire about water level “for dock use”, perhaps it would be more forthcoming to not market the home in all caps as lakefront, take down the outlandishly old photos of the dock, and let Airbnb users know that if they would like to host their family at a lakefront property for their wedding weekend, this is not the place to do so. <br/><br/>As if that wasn’t disappointing enough, the home was 91 degrees when we checked in, and it took a full 24 hours to get the thermostat down to a comfortable temperature.

When I arrived to the city I was told that the listing was “condemned” I was supposed to go a listening in the domain. I then got moved to this different location in the Arboretum after being offered an $800 discount. However on the same day the original location was still up on AirBnB and if I recall correctly at a higher price, and when I called the representatives at AirBnB they told me that the host had told them it was because he was not allowed to actually host a guest over 7 days in the apartment complex, he was essentially doing a rental arbitrage and from my guess he wasn’t actually allowed to do that. I was quite disappointed as the host had a long time to figure this out as I booked weeks in advance and I got the short end of the stick on the day of arrival. They gave me the first half of the $800 discount in the first month (I booked for ~61 days) and gave me the second half of the discount the week prior to checkout. It was difficult to have the host provide the full $800 from my experience I do not understand why it took such a long time to provide the full discount/refund the moment I paid the entire AirBnB cost. In fact I asked whether he could confirm or deny if he was going to send me the other half of the $800 and his reply was just a thank you, a non-answer. I filed a claim for him to send over the money and the host told me that I shouldn’t have done that as it was messing up the system for him to pay me back but the AirBnB reps literally told me I should file a resolution claim to which he could respond to. He sent me a screenshot of the BnB website which literally had a banner on the top of the screen saying he needed to resolve my claim before he can send me money but host insisted that I screwed up and he didn’t know how to send me my money; there was clear instructions literally on screenshot of the website. His reluctance to provide the agreed discount at a reasonable time made things very tricky. Also the host was condescending and treated me as if I were unintelligent and i felt that the host insinuated that I was dumb.

None of them bothers to keep the place just a little bit clean. I had a very short and rough night as I arrived pretty late, hardly slept as I struggled with the situation as well as being grossed out by the bed, to be woken up at 7 am by someone playing the piano in the house. It was awful! Safe your time and money and invest in a proper place. This one is not worth it and should be taken down by Airbnb.<br/><br/>- no bed sheets<br/>- not clean<br/>- shared with two long term renters<br/>- there will be noise (piano at 7 am)<br/>- one small towel<br/>- not accessible by public transport<br/>- no details about the area<br/>- no details about the house itself (room, washing machine, which shelf to use in the bathroom, etc)<br/><br/>You really put the most minimal effort into this Airbnb to make a few cents.

Then after leaving out the buckets and still wet paper towels, we were told that the host didn’t see any evidence and asked if we would take pictures (after we already left). The bathroom doors didn’t even close all the way AND didn’t have locks. How are you supposed to feel comfortable staying with a large group of people when you can’t even lock the bathroom door. Furthermore, there were several lights out in the den. For this amount of money, this place is AWFUL.

Since I picked this place based off of reviews I feel obligated to leave my experience for other people. We arrived and were not able to get into the gated driveway. Finally the next day we were given a code to get in. This was after the neighbor warned us about getting a ticket if we were parked on the mini driveway sidewalk. At the time we had nowhere else to go since we couldn’t get through the gate. Aside from the parking frustration we found 2 live small German roaches in our bathroom, hair all over the floor of bathroom and somebody’s dried contacts. The ice machine on fridge was locked. There was a mini freezer in living room for ice, but it had black slimy mold on all of the corners on the inside. The A/C was locked at 72 and it was 107 degrees outside. We were sweating in our sleep. The “waterfall” on the pool was only on for a super short amount of time so if you were out for the 2 or 3 hrs it’s on in the early afternoon then you missed it. Instead there was a giant purple, yellow and green stain to look at. The pool was way smaller in person and had tree roaches crawling everywhere at night. Now I understand it’s Texas and hot outside so big roaches are inevitable sometimes. The small ones are preventable though. Those are from the house being disgusting. Our feet were black from walking inside the house after 30 mins. Vacasa was nice enough to give us $105 back due to it be so dirty.

The floors were so dirty, we bought our own swifter mop to wash floors. There was a stain on the comforter in master bedroom and it was gross. The extra comforter smelled that I had to wash it before I could use it because I was so disgusted. There was suppose to be a key to get to the pool area, it was in the check in description but there was only the garage opener with the gym button access. The reason I choose this place was because of the pool. My kids were looking forward to going swimming and never ended up going. First of all we couldn’t get in pool area and it looked like the pool was closed too. The company should have all the accurate information regarding pool too, like if it was not open, they should disclose that information. Again big reason we choose this place was because of the pool and were very disappointed. I also called the company about this issue twice and wrote an email in customer service. AllI was told first time was the key should be there even if I told the guy it isn’t and hasn’t been. I went to the office where pool was and guy working there said the company needs to contact them and they would give me a key and when I told the guy on the phone from evonify, he said he would call me back. When he called me back all he said was the key should be there. No help at all. After that I emailed but got no response. Just very disappointed. Overall townhouse was nice looking and in a good location.  My husband and I and 4 kids stayed there and there wasn’t enough towels but when I did call they did bring more towels so that was good, but when you know you have 6 guest they should properly stock the place with towels without us having to call.

The annoying, loud chirping they make when the battery is low. Jean said someone in the department would be notified to look into it asap. I gave approval for someone to look at it while we were out of the home as we had plans. When we arrived back to the home it was late and the smoke detector was still beeping. I did not contact Jean at that time as it was 1:00am. We had to listen to the smoke detector all night which made for a restless night for everyone. Jean was contacted the next day and was I told it was being forwarded to the appropriate department right away. This should have been addressed the day before. We paid good money to stay somewhere that was so nice and comfortable only to have it ruined by a stupid smoke detector. It was something so simple but so annoying.

But, the Host has not maintained it well, and it is now plagued with a moderate-to-severe roach infestation that will be very difficult to eliminate.<br/><br/>Book at your own risk. If you do go for it, try to guide the oily brown critters away from running under the appliances or bed. You can use the frying pan in the kitchen to smash them and be sure to always zip up your luggage to avoid bringing them and their eggs in your belongings back home. Warning: When you smash them, they *will* burst out yellowy, chunky pus. And, future guests: You may want to wash the frying pan if you use it just in case this advice catches on… ;-)<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary, but I ended up contending with at least a dozen roaches during my stay here before relocating. While I noticed a couple during the first couple of days (which put me on guard but didn’t seem like enough to be alarmed), I noticed a handful more on the third day as I became more vigilant—they were probably there all along. I succumbed to sleeping with them crawling around that night since I couldn’t catch them and needed to give an important talk at a research conference in the morning. Hot tip: Wear ear plugs so they won’t burrow into your ears.<br/><br/>Honestly though, I slept soooo bad. Seeing up to half a dozen roaches creeping around and having to sleep in a bed where you saw some crawling nearby just moments before is no small feat. It is a horror that can be scarcely imagined unless you actually experience it firsthand. I wouldn’t want to be subjected to such torture even if I was *being paid*—the TV show “Fear Factor” comes to mind—much less pay my hard-earned money to experience it. Periodically reappearing and eluding capture, the roaches were always still around even if hidden under crevices under the kitchen cabinets and appliances or unreachable beneath the bed.<br/><br/>The next day, about half a dozen more roaches appeared throughout the night after I finally had time to contact the Host and Airbnb about it. Mind you, I was incredibly busy giving two research talks and being involved all day at the conference and then having dinner with friends and colleagues so, yes, this was a day after I became gradually aware that the infestation was serious and widespread.<br/><br/>But, the Host didn’t care and still demanded me to pay in full for the stay—not even a partial refund for that night I tried to sleep with roaches around me after I contacted her about it. She said nope… it doesn’t count since she was already peacefully asleep and didn’t see my message. Ironic, because here I was living in hell unable to sleep by the torment of roaches scurrying around while she blissfully slept. Not my problem... she says… you stay, you pay. At least she knows how to rhyme, right?<br/><br/>In fact, the Host not only showed no compassion but was irate that I got Airbnb involved to help relocate me, culminating in a man working on her behalf entering the unit unannounced when I happened to be taking a shower. He demanded I talk to some property manager on his phone who vulgarly berated me about reaching out to Airbnb hollering, “You’re acting like a child!” while I scrambled to grab a towel to barely cover myself. What the heck. BTW… this violated Airbnb’s Policy for Guest Privacy and Safety not to mention flagrantly disregarded basic human decency and respect.<br/><br/>Realizing that the Host and her affiliates had gone madly vengeful while not thinking twice before freely entering my private space with no warning or permission (even while I might be possibly away), I vacated immediately and coordinated with Airbnb for my safety.<br/><br/>Update: The trauma of living amongst so many roaches is still lingering as I continue to compulsively check for them crawling on the floor or walls around me even when I’m back home. This may not happen to you if you’re psychologically stronger than me. I hope to get over this after a few more weeks.<br/><br/>Another Update: I wonder what the Host and her people would have done if I didn’t quickly vacate as soon as I sensed they were out for revenge? Since they stormed into my unit while I was taking a shower, they wouldn’t feel anything about entering when I’m not there, right? I saw a review for her other listing that someone came in while they were away and stole AirPods which later “magically appeared” in her property manager’s office after the guest complained about it.

Prior to our trip, the hosts had approved an early check-in for an additional $50 fee, but on the morning of our arrival, we were informed they could not honor that early check-in. This was already an inconvenience but we ultimately were okay with this. When we later arrived to check in ~1 hour after the normal check-in time (or 3 hours after our previously arranged early check-in time), the house was still in disarray and the cleaning service had not yet arrived. When the cleaners ultimately arrived, they did a rushed job, leaving behind areas of the house that were still not completely cleaned. We lost a significant portion of our day solely due to this, and it made us feeling uncomfortable for the remainder of our stay not knowing what else had not been fully cleaned.<br/><br/>Although the hosts did apologize and offered us a small payment for our troubles, we felt it was not enough. It is still unclear to us what happened that day, but it seemed like miscommunication between the hosts and the cleaners throughout the entire day, as they were never clear when the cleaners were coming at all and only knew what was going on through messages with our group. It was also a bit confusing as there were multiple hosts messaging us about our reservation and none seemed to take ownership for the check-in/cleaning service.

Also, a few lights are motion activated but stay on for around 15 seconds. It's a pain to retrieve clothing in the master closet as well as the utilities area when lights are turning off and on. <br/><br/>The first time we came there were issues with the water that I mentioned in a private conversation with Minal. A few weeks later, the water situation is still the same with all bathrooms having issues. The guest shower does not drain and your family is left in water up to their ankles. <br/><br/>Additionally, the master bath spews water at 3/4 force from the spout as well as the shower causing massive water waste. <br/><br/>Last, there is only tap water-- the water filter on the sink does not work, and there is no water spigot on the fridge. This was not that big of a deal. <br/><br/>We had asked if we could arrive 2 hours earlier and were told they'd contact us. I didn't hear so I came at 3:30 PM (past checkin time) to find the housekeeper still cleaning. She stated there was a conflict about scheduling and that the family has multiple properties so it's been hectic. It felt peculiar to hear this news from the cleaning service and not from the host directly. She stayed for approximately 45 minutes and there was a completely stuffed full dryer.  <br/><br/>Outside there were piles of dog poop. I had left rolls of dog poop bags when I left and it's disappointing to have a big yard that we cannot play in. <br/><br/>In the kitchen, pieces of the transition flooring had broken off in which someone could get hurt. There were dead ants by the knife block that were not cleaned up. <br/><br/>Additionally I did not receive an apology for losing out on time, and non communication. Later, I did not hear from Rajeev except when he ask if his contractor could come and drop supplies off while we were still here.<br/><br/><br/>Prior to leaving, I received an email that I didn't previously and it sort of set a sour taste in my mouth regarding check out policies because despite that my family was being inconvenienced upon arrival, no APOLOGIES were offered. (See below) <br/><br/>1. Check-out time is 11AM. If you need extra time, please request it as soon as you possibly can. I can sometimes offer it, depending whether the house is booked and on my housekeeper's schedule. There'd be a 39 dollar convenience fee , to handle all the extra communication & co-ordination with my housekeeping staff, guests etc.<br/><br/>2. If you stay after 11AM without requesting for a late checkout, there'll be a $75/hr fee to cover our operational overhead and inconvenience to the incoming guest.<br/><br/>Additionally, at 8:01 AM, when checkout is at 11 AM; I received this message:<br/> <br/>Hi Vivian, Just a gentle reminder that the checkout time is 11:00 AM. My cleaning crew usually arrives 11:15AM.<br/><br/>While none of the below is an absolute must, you'll definitely add a smile on our housekeeper's face, if you took care of any or all of the following before you departed:<br/><br/>1. Collect all used towels and load them in the washer and start a load before you leave. The W/D & laundry pods are in the Utility room next to the kitchen!<br/>2. Remove used sheets, pillowcases from the beds & put them on the floor or the into the black hamper, if you see one in your room.<br/>3. Take the Kitchen Trash bag out in the Trashcan in the garage. If its full, you can just leave it in the garage.<br/>4. Put any used dishes in the dishwasher and start a load<br/><br/>Thanks again for staying at my property. Safe Travels home!<br/><br/>All in all, this was a disappointing experience especially given that I had privately mentioned all issues to the hosts and nothing was done. <br/><br/>I would give this home a rating of a 2 because communication is a must with our family and cleanliness as well. I don't think I would come back because it seems these people care more about finances than the environment and the comfortableness of their guests.

We were told that it was self check-in and the door had a passcode (that was given to us 24h before our trip). I confirmed that our arrival would be late at night. Our flight ended up being delayed, but we didn't think it'd be a big deal since we had mentioned we were arriving late at night anyways and it was a self check-in. <br/><br/>So when we arrived at the airbnb it was around 1am and we tried the code given to us and it didn't work. We thought it was us originally so tried it a bunch of different ways and when it still didn't work we tried to contact the host. <br/><br/>I believe the host uses a management company and they said they'd be available 24/7 during our stay should anything happen. That wasn't true since we tried contacting them over a period of 2 hours to try and figure out how to get into the property and no one responded. By this time it wasn't working and we had to contact airbnb to figure out next steps. <br/><br/>Thank goodness for aircover. Airbnb was able to help us cancel the airbnb and get a refund, but we ended up still having to check into a hotel (it was 4am at this point after going through all the process). <br/><br/>Overall, the check-in experience was frustrating and terrible. This hiccup could have easily been avoided, but clearly no one really checks the door between stays.<br/><br/>The management company did reach out afterwards and offer us to re-book the airbnb after our hotel stay for whatever remaining days we were in Austin to make things right. However, one thing of note is that after all of their cleaning fees and nightly cost, it was more expensive to stay at the airbnb instead of a hotel. We mentioned it was their original fault that we were locked out at 2am and had to go to a hotel, so why should we be charged even more for that, before they lowered the price just enough for it to be less than a hotel stay.",2022-11,-0.8689,2007,2,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The house has lots of space, trendy decor, and things to do.  However, staying in the townhouse for several days as a family was not a great experience.  First, the garage door opener was not working, so we could not enter the house from the garage, and instead had to enter from the front of the property.  The front door is directly on Congress with homeless people living on the bench in front of the house.  It was not a safe situation.  Second, the stairs in the home are steep and open, and renters do not have access to the elevator in the home.  There were too many trips up and down very steep steps.  Third, the home was not well maintained.

We looked around and couldn’t find so we reached out to the host about this matter, at first they didn’t realize that there isn’t one on site and after we told them that, they started arranging one. After almost 2 hours waiting we drove to the nearest gas station to get a tank ourselves, and by the time we get back, the tank the host sent was delivered as well. In the meantime when we were wondering how long it will take for the propane tank to be delivered, one of the responses we got from the host was “If you go to the gas station across the street you may be able to get propane much quicker. We don’t usually supply the propane or charcoal for the grill guests bring their own”, and “If you’re unhappy after one hour of being there it’s probably best if you checkout tonight before you get too settled. I would hate for you to feel the hard work we’ve put into the house was unacceptable for you and your group over propane for the grill.”<br/>So we decided to leave it as it is and continue our stay and if something else would come up during our stay. <br/><br/>During our stay, we noticed a few necessity items that were missing at the house things such as a dish sponge and soap, a kettle, a cutting board, and probably one of the most necessary items in a house on an open land was an “Ant & Roach killer”, the amount of bugs, spiders, scorpions, incests and creatures we had to deal with and kill during this stay was incredible. They were everywhere, kitchen, bedrooms, showers, on beds and sofas literally in every part of the house. At first we kinda dealt with it by killing them, but then after it got out of hand, we sent pictures of those issues to the host, saying that there’s such a matter, they agreed that there’s a lack of a pest control treatment at that house, they asked us if we would like to relocate to a different house, and when we asked for details on that other property, we never heard back from the host. <br/>When we got to the last day of our stay, we were so surprised to get such a rude msg from the host that we need to do the dishes, take out all the trash we had, put all towels in the laundry etc , when we’re charged an extremely high rate of $650 for cleaning. <br/><br/>I do wanna add that the house had a very nice remodel done to it and the finishes were selected nicely. But other than that, there was a lack in hosting experience that made us feel that weren’t been taking care of after considering the amount we paid for only 3 nights.",2022-06,-0.6984,3320,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

So when I went to get back into my room at night, the fob didn’t work, and they had no resolution to get me a new key. We called the owner multiple times and the front desk of the building didn’t have a solution either. So for one of my three nights we were told by the front desk we could sleep on the lobby couch or the street. Hours later we were given a temporary key, but the situation was never rectified, and the entire weekend I had a key to someone else’s room and they had a key to my room.

It is important for future guests to know what to expect:<br/>the house is on the border of a nice residential neighborhood and a more industrial commercial space--the adjoining neighborhood is nice to walk through, but that is not evident at first. It backs onto a loud road, so this room in particular had a lot of traffic noise in the evening. This has the feel of a rooming house--there are ~8 rooms rented in a medium sized house. The other lodgers were nice and no one made much noise, but if the house were full it could be a very different experience.<br/>One note is that the kitchen and bathroom (at least for this en suite room) have very low counters (maybe ADA compliant?).

So as long as you understand it’s a budget location for a reason— then all good there. Stained poor quality towels and the shower temp control is a pain to use.

House wasn’t clean when we were meant to check in (issue with cleaners) but fortunately we live in houston so we just told the host we would delay check in by a day and to remove a day from the reservation. So it worked out in the end but this could have been a headache for others had they flown in or needed the Airbnb that day (host didn’t inform us until very late in the evening on check in day, I think due to poor communications/emergency by cleaner, and originally suggested to cut our cleaning fee in half which didn’t make sense— if someone is telling me the house wasn’t cleaned, I don’t want to stay there.

After we did that, Landing ghosted us for the rest of our stay. <br/><br/>The AC problem was never solved and Landing never stepped up to provide legitimate solutions, so we suffered for 10 weeks. The only ""solution"" anyone at Landing proposed was for us to request to terminate our stay through Airbnb and book a different place, which would have costed us an additional $1,300 or more! That's an insane solution to a simple air conditioning fix that Landing could have contracted themselves for probably a couple hundred bucks. <br/><br/>The check-in process was a disaster and we almost had to get a hotel on the first weekend of our stay because Landing didn't have working keys to the unit.

The room itself was dusty, dirt on the floor, cobwebs on windows/blinds, dirt accumulation on ceiling fan, so I did not turn it on. The main air register in the hallway ceiling of the house was caked in dirt and grime and that's the air we, guests,  breathe in, I can only imagine how the duct work looked. I did not use the shower, as the caulk around the tub was dirty and moldy black. Near the drain was a big metal chipped area. I am glad I only had to stay 1 night, as I would have called Airbnb to cancel my stay and get a refund, if my reservation was for a longer period of time .

I have stayed in over 20 AirBNB rentals for vacation and business purposes and I have never experienced anything as unprofessional as Evonify's listing.<br/><br/>On the first night, we checked in around 10PM. This unit was difficult to find because unit 119 was on the opposite side of the entire building as units 101-117. This was very confusing, and the customer support did not assist us at all and just said ""There's definitely unit 119 there."".<br/><br/>Upon checking in, we had to kill a spider, two cockroaches, and there were multiple flies flying around the unit. In addition, there was no toilet paper in the unit. After contacting the customer support about both issues, there was no resolution. They said they would bring toilet paper in the morning and try to relocate us to a new unit.<br/><br/>The next day, there was no toilet paper delivered. In the afternoon, they moved us to unit 122.

It’s a tiny space that does look exactly like the photos, so upon arrival, when I saw hair on the floor from the previous guests and a film of dust under the bed, I was surprised at the lack of cleanliness. I swept it, sent them some photos, and informed the hosts of the condition of the space. <br/><br/>Jason & Meredith (the hosts) said they would send a cleaning lady the next morning. The internet was out that following morning as well so I left to go work from a cafe & when I came back the place looked the exact same, even though I was told the cleaning lady had been there. With Airbnb's exorbitant cleaning fees, I do not expect to have to sweep or dust, or have to deal with hair around me. I've been to so many Airbnbs that are spotlessly clean that this was very unwelcoming.<br/><br/>I reached out to the hosts again and they sent the cleaning lady again (even though they expressed that it was not necessary). Nancy, the cleaning lady angrily knocked on the door and rudely asked me “What do I need to clean up?” She then pointed at my hair & my suitcases and said I was the reason the place was dirty. At this point, she was so angry with me, didn’t let me speak, and said “I’m having a day!”, I had no choice but to ask her to leave. I didn’t feel safe & her behavior was shockingly unprofessional.<br/><br/>I packed up my belongings and left right after this encounter (within 18 hours of my 5-day planned stay). Nancy has the code to my place and I was not going to risk another volatile encounter. I expressed this concern to the hosts and they said that Nancy would never behave like this…that they would not refund the days as they felt that they had addressed all my needs.<br/><br/>It was my choice to leave, but for me, a young woman staying alone, it seemed safer to lose the money than stay in a dirty, dusty, volatile & unsafe space. I ended up staying on a friend's couch and checking into a hotel towards the end of my trip. Looks like I won’t ever get my money back and once again Airbnb & unfit hosts will get away with unprofessional behaviors.

There is a washer - actually 3, but note that they are shared by residents in the complex and appear to require a credit card (Sevin informed me they required a code, but I could find no way to type the code in). Also note that trash is collected outdoors in a large trash bin that was greatly overflowing during my stay, and the thin-walled complex is on a corner next to a heavily traveled (and, hence, often noisy) street.<br/><br/>I was also abit troubled that at the end of my stay, Sevin instructed, “If your stay was unpleasent and things were out of the normal in ANY kind of way.

The check out instructions require we fully clean (vacuum, remove every fiber of dog fur, start linens, etc.) and yet we are still charged a deep cleaning fee? The floors had dust bunnies and turned my feet black upon arrival so clearly not cleaned / mopped besides whatever guests do before they leave. Not sure what I am paying a deep cleaning fee for then? Also don’t make your place pet friendly if you then tell me I’ll be charged $100 if you find any pet fur at all when we leave. Again WHAT is the deep cleaning fee for then?

Its a good spot to stay if you're in town to explore the city and just need a place to crash that has all the necessities.  The beds were firm and comfortable.  The neighborhood was quiet and there is a shared backyard area, though we didn't use it.  The living/kitchen area was small and the walls/doors are quite thin, but that didn't really surprise us given the price.  Checking in was easy and we didn't have any major issues throughout our stay.  The only minor issues are there are various forms to fill out throughout your stay in case you are going to arrive late or check out early, which was a minor annoyance.  And if you indicate during your booking that you are bringing a pet, they don't include the pet cleaning fee in the booking price, which seems misleading to me.  It is fine to charge an extra fee for pets, but it seems misleading to me to not see the entire price of the stay at the time of booking, especially if your booking information shows that you are bringing a pet.

Poor Communication- <br/><br/>I attempted to reach host at 8 PM to ensure everything was ready, however did not hear back until next day, AFTER messaging multiple times at night advising we couldn’t get in, and reaching out to her again at almost 8am, I finally heard back next day. Star stated she had an emergency. <br/><br/>2. Terrible check-in- <br/><br/>Once we arrived we were unable to get in through the garage because we were missing the sticker from the box. We went back to the key box various times and looked around the floor to ensure it wasn’t misplaced. By the time we were able to get in, by following a car, it was 1:15 AM. Again, this was happening & no response from host.<br/><br/>2. VERY Unsanitary conditions! - <br/><br/>Dirty bed sheets, floor sticky, 1 bed had the wooden slats (frame) falling apart. Oreo packaging under bed. Dust. We SLEPT in dirty beds! (Wait for it) Dishwater was making noise, not fully closed - dishes were dirty inside. When we woke up in the morning, the second guest bed had blood stains and on bed sheets, I was so embarrassed as I picked this airbnb for the 3 of us to reunite. We sent pictures, Star immediately apologizes stating it was unacceptable. My bed had body fluids on sheets and frame. Star explained this has never happened to her before… Asked us when we can leave for a few hrs so that they can clean the property. We had to leave for a few hours! She offered us our cleaning fee in return, but by the time we got back it was a whole day lost (after 4pm was the time to return). My party asked for half off, as we were only staying 2 nights. This was a reasonable request - given all that had happened. Host declined.<br/><br/>I do believe Star attempted to fix our experience. But the conditions of the property and, the body fluids noticeably on the bed and bedframe, the dirty towels and bedsheets full of oil, sticky floors.

The apartment is nice enough, but again, is sort of student quality. For example, there's only about 5 minutes of hot water available, make showers brief and lukewarm.

NOPE. Got there at 3:30 pm on that very Friday, and still no instructions. Also it was AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. I couldn't get in because a gate code is required. He also was very vague with the instructions on the default messages ""key in the lock box"", which was an occurring theme.....which is dumb because WHERE IS THIS LOCKBOX? He didn't even tell me where the unit is. There are like 100 apartment units and probably 8-12 buildings and I'm supposed to just find a needle in a hay stack? And not only that....he said he didn't want me to go in there because it wasn't cleaned up yet, WHY WOULD HE LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS (however vague) TO FIND KEYS IF HE DIDNT WANT ME TO GO INTO HIS UNIT? So I tried calling him, 6-7 times. I texted him even. He claimed he was ""on the other line"" but we all know it takes 10 seconds to make a courtesy text while on a call. He was not very about his business with the whole thing and just seemed either highly incompetent or just a scammer. I am inclined to think the latter. now here is the kicker, I guess he thought I'd just give up after not hearing from him. I thought, maybe I'll ask if the front office of the apartment knows anything about this guy. Turns out he wasn't even supposed to sub-lease to anyone else on Airbnb. They asked to see the messages, and I figured, if he is going to treat me like an idiot I might as well. And as I'm leaving the property, lo and behold, HE CALLS ME. And somehow he knew I went to the front office. I guess that put a fire under him to be about his business. So this is when he was going on about ""my maid hasn't cleaned the room yet, come after 5"". So I'm being VERY PATIENT with him at this point and figured I would give him another chance. I went to Austin City Limits and MY VIBE WAS RUINED FROM THE WHOLE THING. I just wanted to check in on him, and the room, while I'm trying to enjoy the show. He texted back and said ""it's best to cancel now, since this thing is a whole mess"". First of all, WHY DIDN'T HE CANCEL AND GIVE ME BACK MY REFUND? It's bad enough I'm stranded now (I ended up trying to sleep in my own car, which I couldn't) but now if I myself canceled, I saw I wasn't eligible for a refund. So for the longest I tried to contact support throught text, as I was trying to multitask watching a concert while getting this mess handled, and I happened to misclick to cancel the booking. I NEED MY MONEY! I work all day driving strangers around, for 12-16 hours to make the money I did to spend on this reservation. HARD, EXHAUSTING, AND EVEN RISKY WORK.

Their response was to send someone out in the morning but we had already been without heat the first night since they did not leave the remote to the split unit in our room where it should have been.

I booked this very expensive place because it said it had a hot tub- it was going to be cold during my stay and it was really important to me to relax in a hot tub during my vacation- but there was no hot tub. I contacted the owner through the app and all they would do is tell me there wasn’t a hot tub (duh). In my opinion, if a place isn’t as advertised for a major amenity then some kind of discount or at least an apology for their inaccurate listing is in order. It’s not like the hot tub was closed- it just doesn’t exist. They refused to provide a small discount when asked. <br/><br/>Things the listing says it has but doesn’t:<br/>-A “dedicated” workspace- there was nowhere i could even sit and access a plug for my laptop.<br/>-Cooking essentials- there was no salt, pepper, or oil. <br/>-As mentioned, there is no hot tub. <br/>-Didn’t see a high chair in the unit, not sure if they would be able to provide on request, but i doubt it. <br/><br/>If this place is trying to compete with the downtown or Rainey Street hotels then it has a long way to go- there was no hand soap in the bathroom, parking was crazy expensive, and the cleaning fee was huge- yet you are asked to strip the beds and take out the trash- what’s the $150 fee for then? Just save yourself the trouble and stay at a real hotel where there’s staff to help you, cleaning fees aren’t insane, and the amenities are accurate - Hotel van Zandt is nice, Hotel San Jose for south congress, or the Hilton austin downtown~actually~ has a hot tub.

I found it a little strange that the check-out procedures were so detailed (e.g. absolutely nothing -no food or drink- should be left behind, run the dishwasher, take out all trash, set the temp to 68, put everything back where you found it, all subject to charge) but we were satisfied at first so I didn't think much of it. That being said, we found a baby roach on our first day and I sent a picture to the host to let her know that she might want to further investigate after we leave. She offered to schedule pest control and get some spray, which was very considerate although she never followed through. The problem was day 2. We continued to see baby roaches and medium-sized roaches which pointed toward an infestation. She assured me there was no infestation and claimed that bugs in Texas are common (which is not true since I'm from Texas but even if it was, does not mean we should be seeing ~10 within 24 hours in the kitchen). She offered to schedule maintenance the morning of our check-out, which was obviously unhelpful to the current situation. <br/><br/>We were left unsatisfied with the vague responses and lack of action the host provided, so we requested a refund and a place to relocate for the night. With that, she became very slow to respond and curt with her replies. For example, when we asked when we could expect any action, her reply was ""I will see what we can do."" and ""As soon as a response is received."" At that point I realized it was useless to try to reason with a host who was not understanding (a first for me) and denied your problem so I escalated the issue to Airbnb. In retrospect, I looked at her other reviews and there were some definite red flags I missed. One review mentions the host runs like a business which 100% sums up our interaction. No action was taken and she stopped responding to my messages altogether. Her cleaning fee of $75 was pretty unreasonable considering we spent a good chunk of time going over her procedures when we left to avoid any check-out charges. I'd advise those who are uncomfortable with roaches like I am or those who, when faced with a problem, want it addressed in a timely and respectful manner to avoid this listing and host as the situation was disastrous.",2022-12,-0.9644,2349,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

Wish I could consider staying here again, but I decidedly cannot...<br/><br/>I won't stay in another FrontDesk facility.  And that is disappointing because they seem to own a lot of the places in the area.  I spent an hour trying to get access to the unit/parking (they sent me the wrong door access code and I had to stand in a hallway for 15 minutes waiting to get a response/resolution) and then lots of driving around in their parking garage and going up/down stairs because the parking pass wouldn't open the gate repeatedly and the key fob only worked on some access doors.  I don't blame the people (who were lovely, but I mostly got a lot of ""oh no, sorry!"" responses...  I got a total of 7 ""sorry"" text messages in one evening), just their systems.  Hell, had somebody offered a $20 discount for my time or some other nominal gesture of goodwill, I probably would have felt like they were feeling my pain a little.  A local rep did finally offer to come out to swap cards with me and while I was waiting the 15-20 minutes for her to arrive, I found a workaround to get in so my car wouldn't get towed.  It was just super frustrating and a giant time suck.<br/><br/>And this is nobody's fault, but just was another nail in the coffin of my experience...  the LOUD building-wide fire alarm went off at 1:30am during my one-night stay that landed me and most of the other tenants on the sidewalk for half an hour while the fire department resolved it.  I couldn't go back to sleep till 4am.  Which means I spent 1 hour trying to get access to a place I only slept in for about 4 hours total.<br/><br/>This was my first trip of many (I was just assigned to a project in Austin and will be renting a place weekly for the next few months) and at least my trip there confirmed that the Domain is a great place to stay.  But if you want a more personalized and well-run experience, I don't recommend a FrontDesk-operated space.<br/><br/>Also, if you see a contractor working on the first floor of a building doing overnight work and they're grinding concrete, but too dumb to wear a mask to protect from silica dust, they're probably also too dumb to cover the smoke detector or put the building fire alarm into test mode.

I was sent a video to try and fix the equipment out back which was not my job and didn’t work. And nothing was don’t about the roaches .

This contact information is used to spam you with tediously specific instructions on how to circumnavigate a variety of obstacles which clearly indicate that the building owners don't intend for tenants to be renting out their places.  Among these instructions are details on how to download, install, and register with the phone app Pavel invites you to which is required to open doors and use elevators in the building (more on that later), a request that guests don't mention to the concierge that they are staying at an Airbnb, and a completely flawed procedure on how to get the falsely advertised ""free on-premesis parking"".  I was fairly busy before check-in and I had to pause what I was doing in several instances to coordinate arrival times, provide additional contact information, and confirm I received app invites.<br/><br/>The app to open doors was a pain to figure out and on multiple occasions we had to ask for help from people who live in the building (just to watch them struggle with the same thing).  Cell service in the garage was bad, amplifying the annoyance.  Worst of all, the ""free parking"" required that we use a key card on exit, but the terminal said something along the lines of ""user has already left the building"" and I ended up having to pay $48 for the night before bringing the keycard back upstairs to the apartment!<br/><br/>This place is a hassle and I would recommend avoiding it.

Great area of Downtown Austin, but a bit noisy on the patio, because of the freeway.<br/><br/>The check-in process was a bit clumsy. Someone had to meet us and we thought the time was set at 4pm, but the host company arrived at 3pm. At 3pm, we were on our way to lunch and he asked us if we could Uber back for the key. I thought that was a bit odd. We told him no, that we would be back at 4pm. In the end, he made it work for us. I would highly suggest that they get a keypad lock on the condo door, and avoid this checkin hassle for future guests.

Upon arrival to a dirty Airbnb, Mayer offered to move me to a new property. Later that night somebody tried to break in. I immediately contacted Mayer and explained to her what unfolded. She responded by saying nobody else had the code and was I sure that happened…and to take the smart lock off because she wants it… she then stopped responding altogether.

All communication was cumbersome requiring calling an off-site number even when I was on site. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:<br/>1)	Beginning three days before my scheduled arrival at Natiivo in Austin, Texas, I began sending emails and texts and making phone calls to ask about check-in as I was transporting considerable luggage, food, and flowers. My simple request was to talk to someone onsite. Promises were made to call me back, but it did not happen. No response was received for most of my emails and texts.<br/>2)	Finally, I received a call one hour before I was scheduled to leave for Austin. The information I was given was incorrect. I was told that carts would be available for the luggage, but they were not.<br/>3)	At the end of our stay, I requested a late check-out and was told to call an offsite number, which I declined to do as I did not want to waste another two hours on hold with Vacasa.<br/>I was told that Vacasa is attempting to marry the hotel and AirBnB experience. Unfortunately, the result is the removal of all the benefits leaving only the disadvantages. Vacasa failed to meet basic expectations, including, but not limited to the following:<br/>1)	One of the reasons we chose to stay in an AirBnB was we wanted a kitchen. When renting an AirBnB, one assumes that a kitchen will be provided and that that kitchen will have a conventional oven. That was an incorrect assumption.  The oven was a fancy microwave with a detailed instruction book. Reading an instruction book is not what I want to do on vacation.<br/>2)	I assumed that I would be able to cook in the kitchen; however, very basic equipment was missing. <br/>3)	When staying at a hotel or AirBnB, one assumes that coffee will be provided, but Vacasa did not provide it. We brought K-cups because Keurig is the type machine most hotels provide, but Vacasa did not have a Keurig. Vacasa provided a coffee maker but no coffee. Again, poor communication, see point 1 above.<br/>4)	The “pillows” were eight inches thick and hard as a rock. They were the most uncomfortable pillows I had ever encountered in fifty years of travel.<br/>5)	No luggage carts were available either when I checked in or when I checked out.",2022-05,-0.9588,2477,1,0.0,-1,Fake,Strong Negative

The coffee maker is a Nespresso machine for which no pods are provided nor sold in any nearby location this rendering it useless and misleading in their listing. The cookware provided consists of one sauce pan, a 6 inch pan, and a pot. There’s also a blender.

I asked if I could check in early and was asked to pay a extra fee for the service. On the day of my arrival, I informed Edouard that I would be in around 11am or 12pm to check in. He was confused and told me I never paid to check in early even though I had paid days prior to the trip. Thats when he let me know he was sending a cleaning crew and had to ""kick out"" those who were staying in the apartment before me. He told me the cleaning could get done in 30 min.
